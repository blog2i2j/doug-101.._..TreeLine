            <h1>What is TreeLine?</h1>

            <p>Do you have lots of sticky notes lying around with various
            useful information jotted down?  Or many lists of books, movies,
            website logins, personal contacts, or things to do?  Can you find
            them when you need them?  Well, I often couldn't.  So here's my
            answer.</p>

            <p>Some would call TreeLine an Outliner, others would call it a
            PIM.  Basically, it just stores almost any kind of information.  A
            tree structure makes it easy to keep things organized.  And each
            node in the tree can contain several fields, forming a
            mini-database.  The output format for each node can be defined,
            and the output can be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to
            html.</p>

            <p>A source code repository is available at <a
            href="https://github.com/doug-101/TreeLine">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>There is a low-volume email list for users to discuss TreeLine.

              <li>Fix a minor bug affecting default directories for save-as
              and export commands when there is not already a file name set.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>February 20, 2019 - Release 3.1.0 (beta release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is a beta release of TreeLine. Some new features have
              not been extensively tested, but major bugs are unlikely.
              Testing and bug reports are appreciated, but those with very
              critical work should consider using the stable release
              (TreeLine 3.0.x).</li>

              <li>GUI translations are available in German and Spanish, but
              they still require minor updates to cover recent changes.
              Volunteers are also needed to update or create translations in
              additional languages.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A Select in Tree command was added to the Title List's
              right-click context menu. It selects the node corresponding to
              the current line in the Title List editor. This makes it easier
              to edit or add children to an item.</li>

              <li>A minimize to system tray option was added to General
              Options (under Features Available). If enabled, it adds a
              TreeLine system tray icon to toggle application display and
              hides the taskbar entry when TreeLine is minimized.</li>

              <li>An optional dark color theme was added to General Options
              (under Appearances).</li>

              <li>A new Regenerate References command was added to the Data
              menu. It forces updates to all conditional types and math
              fields. It should only be necessary for comparisons to current
              dates/times or for externally modified data.</li>

              <li>Added support for current date and time references to math
              fields. Special field names ({*Now_Date*}, {*Now_Time*} and
              {*Now_Date_Time*}) must be manually typed in equations.</li>

              <li>A new Show Configuration Structure command was added to the
              Data menu. This opens a read-only visualization of complex type
              structures as another TreeLine file.</li>

              <li>An indent (pretty print) output option was added to General
              Options (under Features Available). This makes saved TreeLine
              JSON files easier for humans to read at the expense of somewhat
              larger file sizes.</li>

              <li>The Evaluate HTML tags control was enabled for date, time,
              boolean and math fields. This allows HTML tags to be evaluated
              or ignored in more field types.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The top root node is now selected at file open if there is
              not a recent selection state to restore. Previously these files
              opened with no selection, which could cause confusion.</li>

              <li>Non-editable math fields in the Data Edit view show as gray
              when the mouse hovers over them.</li>

              <li>Some unnecessary libraries were eliminated from the Windows
              installer to reduce download sizes and installed space
              requirements.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed the truncation of node titles that are generated from
              the first line of HTML Text fields.</li>

              <li>Some redundant newline characters were removed from text
              storage in TreeLine files.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>November 17, 2018 - Release 3.0.3 (stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed an error when adding child count fields to the output
              format.</li>

              <li>Problems with writing config files in Windows portable
              installations were fixed.</li>

              <li>Improved error handling after failing to read or write
              config files.</li>

              <li>In the Windows installer, improve the deletion of files from
              older versions and avoid problems if installing into a directory
              shared with other applications.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 20, 2018 - Release 3.0.2 (stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Upgraded the Windows binary from Python 3.6 to Python
              3.7.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed nonfunctional printing commands under Windows by
              building the Windows binary using PyInstaller rather than
              cx_Freeze.</li>

              <li>Multiple issues with printing long nodes were fixed.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems saving files when the blanks as zeros
              property was changed for math fields.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>September 29, 2018 - Release 3.0.1 (stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Added a Spanish GUI translation (thanks to Diego).</li>

              <li>Added a read-only text box to the Help &gt; About dialog to
              allow copying of the version and library information.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a problem opening old TreeLine files that had format
              changes in File Info fields.</li>

	      <li>TreeLine files with invalid child references can now be
              opened. A warning message is given about the missing child nodes
              in the corrupt file.</li>

	      <li>The Sort command now properly sorts multiple root nodes when
              sorting the entire tree.</li>

	      <li>Now forces references to AM/PM in time field formats to be
              output regardless of system locale settings.</li>

	      <li>Data from fields that were removed from the configuration is
              now purged when a file is saved. This avoids missing matches in
              the Clone All Matched Nodes command.</li>

	      <li>Fixed various errors when applying advanced clone and
              category commands from the Data menu to complex node
              structures.</li>

	      <li>Fixed some problems with using the Undo command after
              complex operations.</li>

	      <li>Fix an error caused by attempting to use the Edit &gt; Cut
              command when there is only one node.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>August 19, 2018 - Release 3.0.0 (new stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is the first stable release of a major TreeLine
              rewrite. It includes all of the new features shown below in the
              2.1.x and 2.9.x development series.</li>

              <li>TreeLine files now use a JSON format in place of the old XML
              format. This provides more flexibility for structuring new
              features like cloned nodes and multiple root nodes. A new file
              extension (".trln) helps to distinguish files with the new
              format. Import and export filters are provided for older
              TreeLine version 2.x and 1.x files. The older files can be
              opened using the standard "File &gt; Open" command.</li>

              <li>A GUI translations is available in German.  All other

            <h2>June 30, 2018 - Release 2.9.2 (unstable development
              snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is a development snapshot of TreeLine that should be
                considered a release candidate for an upcoming stable release.
                Many bugs have been fixed. User testing and bug reports are
                appreciated.</li>

              <li>This is a major rewrite of TreeLine. Once it becomes fully
                stable, it will be released as TreeLine version 3.0.0.</li>

              <li>A GUI translations is available in German.  All other
                translations are out of date and have not been included.

                languages.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The German GUI translation was updated (thanks to Maria
                Seliger).</li>

              <li>The expand/collapse status of nearby nodes is maintained
                while editing the node structure.  This includes adding,
                deleting, moving and indenting nodes.</li>

              <li>The expanded/collapsed and selected tree states are now
                saved even if changes were discarded in the previous
                session.</li>

              <li>A click on a tree node to restore tree focus no longer
                starts editing the node title.</li>

              <li>The enter key now selects a tree node after the first title
                letter(s) are typed to make it current (shown with a box
                around the title).</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Several errors occurring when deleting or removing nodes
                have been fixed.  These include problems when the mouse is
                pre-highlighting descendant nodes and when nodes to be
                deleted are selected in a separate window.</li>

              <li>Fixed node title editing errors caused by moving the mouse
                to a data edit box with the title edit still active.</li>

              <li>Fixed errors occurring when field types are changed after
                initial default values have been set.</li>

            <h2>March 31, 2018 - Release 2.9.1 (unstable development
              snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot of TreeLine. It has
                improved but could still contain bugs. Testing and bug reports
                are appreciated, but those with very critical work should
              consider using the stable release (TreeLine 2.0.x).</li>

              <li>This is a major rewrite of TreeLine. Once it becomes more
                stable, it will be released as TreeLine version 3.0.0. The
                2.1.x unstable series is being discontinued (no stable 2.2.0
              release is planned).</li>

              <li>The GUI and documentation translations are out of date and
                have not been included.  Volunteers are needed to update
                translations in several languages.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A new HTML export uses Javascript and CSS to create a live
                tree view. Nodes in the tree can be expanded and collapsed,
                and a separate pane shows the output for all descendants of
                the selected node. One form of this export creates separate
                files that are linked to the existing TreeLine file. These
                files are intended for use on a web server (browser security
                usually prevents local access). Only the TreeLine file needs
                to be replaced to update the data (re-export is not required).
                The second form creates a single file (with embedded data)
              that can be accessed from a local web browser.</li>

              <li>New forms of CSV table text imports and exports can work
                with multiple levels of child nodes, preserving the tree
                structure.  The first column of the table includes a level
              number that is incremented for child relationships.</li>

              <li>Added a custom time select dialog box for editing Time and
                TimeDate fields.</li>

              <li>A new general option controls whether inaccessible files are
                removed from the recent file list at startup. The files are
                removed by default, but this can be changed to avoid losing
              listings of files stored on removable drives.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fix errors shown when using copy commands after closing
                TreeLine windows.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with copy / paste and drag / drop on nodes
                with conditional type settings.</li>

              <li>Avoid problems showing the tree view after closing a filter
                command that found no matches.</li>

              <li>Fixed issues on Windows with pull-down combo boxes not
                working after repeatedly showing some dialogs (mostly find and
                filter dialogs).</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with generic XML export from multiple root
                nodes.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with number field formatting when using a ","
                radix with exponents.</li>

              <li>Avoid issues resolving relative paths between different
                Windows drive letters in external link fields.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with advanced ancestor field output
                references in some tree locations.</li>

              <li>Properly update the right-hand views after using a new
                window command.</li>

              <li>Avoid problems running data category-based commands on
                selections without any child nodes.</li>

              <li>Fixed minor spacing issues for tables shown in output views
                and HTML exports.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>January 28, 2018 - Release 2.9.0 (unstable development
            snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot of TreeLine. It
                could contain bugs. Testing and bug reports are appreciated,
                but the stable release (TreeLine 2.0.x) is recommended for
              critical work.</li>

              <li>This is a major rewrite of TreeLine. Once it becomes more
                stable, it will be released as TreeLine version 3.0.0. The
                2.1.x unstable series is being discontinued (no stable 2.2.0
              release is planned).</li>

              <li>The GUI and documentation translations are out of date and
                have not been included.  Volunteers are needed to update
                translations in several languages.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>TreeLine files now uses a new JSON format in place of the
                old XML format. This provides more flexibility for structuring
                new features like cloned nodes and multiple root nodes.  A new
              file extension (".trln) helps to distinguish these files.</li>

              <li>Import and export filters are provided for older TreeLine
                version 2.x and 1.x files. The older files can be opened using
                the standard "File &gt; Open" command.</li>

              <li>Multiple top-level (root) nodes are now permitted. When no
                nodes are selected in the tree (by clicking on a blank area or
                Ctrl clicking to unselect), the right-hand view will show
              information about all of the top-level nodes.</li>

              <li>A new breadcrumb view pane above the other panes shows a
                sequence of ancestor titles for a selected node. The ancestors
                can be clicked to select them. For cloned nodes, multiple
              lines provide links to each instance's ancestor sequence.</li>

              <li>By default, the edit boxes in the data edit view now
                activate when the mouse hovers over them. This eliminates the
                need to click to activate them. This feature can be disabled
              in general options if desired.</li>

              <li>When a file is opened in an existing window, the window is
                now reused (not just replaced) to eliminate flashing.</li>

              <li>Cloned nodes now have a more native and efficient
                implementation.  This allows the same nodes to have multiple
                parents.  The new breadcrumb view shows a list of clones for
              the selected node that can be clicked to select the other
              instances.</li>

              <li>New paste commands have been added for adding nodes before
                and after siblings.  There are also multiple paste commands
                for adding clones of nodes.</li>

              <li>Cloned nodes can be created automatically from all identical
                nodes by using the "Data &gt; Clone All Matched Nodes"
                command.</li>

              <li>The new "Data &gt; Detach Clones" command converts cloned
                nodes in selected branches back into independent nodes.</li>

              <li>A new "Swap Category Levels" command swaps child and
                grandchild nodes beneath a selected node. A child node with
                multiple nodes under it will become cloned under each one. Any
              existing grandchild clones will become individual nodes with
              multiple children.</li>

              <li>Child node types that are available to be set can be
                limited. A new pull-down list of child type limits is in the
                "Type Config" tab of the configuration dialog if the advanced
              functions are shown.</li>

              <li>The Date, Time and DateTime fields  have new format strings
                that enable extra text to be added to the date output.</li>

              <li>To improve efficiency, user visible node unique IDs that
                depend on the node's data have been removed.</li>

              <li>Error handling has been improved.  For most errors, a dialog
                box is shown with debugging information that can be copied
                into an email.</li>

              <li>Added a desktop specification file to the Linux installer
                for desktop environment menu support.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>February 20, 2017 - Release 2.1.0 (unstable development
            snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>TreeLine has been ported from the Qt4 library to the Qt5
                library. The system requirements have been updated to Python
                3.4 or higher, PyQt 5.4 or higher and Qt 5.4 or higher.</li>

              <li>Cloned nodes that can duplicate sections of the tree have
                been added. Editing their data or child structure in one
                location changes all locations. They are created by copying
                nodes and then using the "Edit-&gt;Paste Cloned Node" command
                to paste them elsewhere. The clone link can be removed by
                deleting the nodes or by cutting them and pasting them back
                using the regular paste command.</li>

              <li>Added a new DateTime field that combines dates and times
                into a single field that is useful for timestamps. The editor
                format is a combination of the date and time formats from the
                general options, separated by a space.</li>

              <li>Added an option to allow HTML tags in Choice, AutoChoice,
                Combination, AutoCombination and RegularExpression fields. The
                control is in the Field Config tab of the Configure Data Types
                dialog. This option is disabled by default. If enabled,
                special characters (angled brackets and quotation marks) will
                need to be escaped to show up in text.</li>

              <li>Saved rules for Conditional Find and Conditional Filter
                commands are listed directly in the dialog boxes, making them
                easier to load and save.</li>

              <li>Added comma-delimited (CSV) table import and export, similar
                to existing tab-delimited table import and export. The export
                only handles data from a single level of child nodes.</li>

              <li>Added a quick, incremental search of node titles. By
                default, it's bound to ctrl+/. Then, matching titles are found
                as the search string is typed. The F3 and shift+F3 keys can be
                used to go to the next or previous matches, respectively.</li>

              <li>Multiple fields can now be selected in the Output page of
                the Configuration dialog, so several fields can be added to
                the formats simultaneously.</li>

              <li>A pull-down selector for printers has been added to the
                Print Setup dialog. This enables TreeLine to verify that the
                page size and margin settings are supported by the current
                printer.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li> The SpacedText Field now allows special HTML characters
                (angled brackets and quotation marks) without requiring them
                to be manually escaped.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>The code that splits content into pages when printing has
                been improved. It now handles very long nodes better.</li>

              <li>When formatted fields (dates, times, etc.) are used in node
                titles, editing the titles in the tree or in the Title List
                pane will now work if the edit and output formats are
              similar.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 3, 2015 - Release 2.0.2 (new stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a major regression in 2.0.1 that broke data editors
                for most specialized field types (number, math, boolean,
                choice, etc.)</li>

            <h2>May 17, 2015 - Release 2.0.0 (new stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Modified the Treepad file import to use SpacedText fields to
                more closely match Treepad formatting.</li>

              <li>An optional plugin was written that can export files to the
                Treepad text file format.</li>

              <li>The TreeLine icon was replaced with a new one.  Thanks to
                David Reimer for contributing the artwork.</li>

              <li>The German and Portuguese GUI translations were
                updated.</li>

              <li>Updated the long text sample file to include the SpacedText
                field type, and added a conditional equation to the math
                sample file.</li>

              <li>Updated the Math Field section of the documentation.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Compatibility Notes:</b>

              <li>There are some file format changes between TreeLine 1.4.x
              and this version of TreeLine.</li>

              <li>Older files opened in this version are automatically
              converted when saved.</li>

            <h2>March 29, 2015 - Release 1.9.7 (unstable development
            snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot of a full rewrite
                of TreeLine. It is nearly ready for a stable release, but it
                could still contain bugs.  Testing and bug reports are
              appreciated.</li>

              <li>The GUI and documentation translations are not yet
                complete.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Added comparison operators and conditional if statements to
                math field equations. The operators can be used with a new
                boolean result type, or as a part of numeric, date, time or
              text expressions.</li>

              <li>Text operators were made available in math field equations,
                and the result type can be set to text. This allows math
                fields to combine text from other fields, replace substrings
              and change capitalization.</li>

              </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Added a "file saved" status bar message.</li>

              <li>Added a German GUI translation.</li>

              <li>Updated the Portuguese GUI translation.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a focus problem that made Combination and
                AutoCombination field editor pull-downs unusable.</li>

              <li>Fixed a focus problem that made the pull-downs in choice and
                boolean field editors unusable on Linux.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Compatibility Notes:</b>

              <li>There are some file format changes between TreeLine 1.4.x
              and this version of TreeLine.</li>

              <li>Older files opened in this version are automatically

            <h2>March 10, 2015 - Release 1.9.6 (unstable development
            snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot of a full rewrite
                of TreeLine. It could still contain bugs.  Testing and bug
                reports are appreciated.</li>

              <li>The GUI and documentation translations are not yet
                complete.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Added a new OneLineText field type that restricts the text
                length to a single line.</li>

              <li>Added an All Types option to the conditional find and filter
                commands. This allows multiple node types to be found or
                filtered at the same time. The fields from every type are
                available for use in conditions. The conditions give a false
                result for all node types that do not contain that field
                name.</li>

              <li>Added support for date and time calculations using math
                fields. Math equation result types can be set to numeric, date
                or time output. Date fields can be subtracted to give the
                number of days elapsed, and numbers of days can be added to or
                subtracted from dates, resulting in new dates. Time fields can
                be subtracted to give the number of seconds elapsed, and
                numbers of seconds can be added to or subtracted from times,
                resulting in new times.</li>

              <li>In math fields, added an equation reference level to
                reference fields in the root node. This provides a place for
                "constant" field values that can be referenced from any node
                but only need to be changed in one location.</li>

              <li>Support was added for plugin extension modules. Most of the
                interface methods from TreeLine 1.4.x were duplicated to ease
                porting of old plugins. Of course, old plugins must be ported
                from Python 2.x to Python 3.x, and there are multi-window
                implementation differences. New interfaces allow the creation
                of new field types and the execution of any menu command.
                Sample plugins are available on the TreeLine download
                page.</li>

              <li>Added text formatting and link commands for HTML fields that
                add tags to the HTML content.</li>

              <li>An open in folder command was added to external link field
                editors to open the directory in a file manager.</li>

              <li>Added the Select All command to global menus with a
                different default shortcut key (ctrl-L) to avoid conflicts
                with the add child shortcut.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Improved the focus handling for data edit view edit boxes.
                This eliminates the blue outline for boxes in inactive data
                edit views. It also makes tab-to-focus more predictable,
                including fully selecting single-line field types when they
                receive tab focus.</li>

              <li>Data edit boxes are now automatically resized when editing
                is complete and the focus moves to another row.</li>

              <li>Allow files to be drag &amp; dropped on data edit boxes to
                create external links.</li>

              <li>Small, non-modal dialogs, such as those for sorting,
                numbering, finding and filtering, have been set to stay on
                top, so they won't be obscured by TreeLine windows.</li>

              <li>Made opening associated programs from external file links
                more consistent, especially in Linux.</li>

              <li>The copy types from file command now supports encrypted and
                compressed files.</li>

              <li>Added wait cursors to TreeLine operations that could be time
                consuming.</li>

              <li>Improved the consistency of context menus and shortcut
                commands used in edit boxes.</li>

              <li>Added a nearly complete Portuguese GUI translation.</li>

              <li>Added support for sample TreeLine files to be provided in
                alternate languages.</li>

              <li>Prepared the help file for translation into other
                languages,</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Corrupted TreeLine files with the same unique ID assigned to
                multiple nodes no longer fail to open. The user is warned that
                unique IDs have been updated, which could break some internal
                links.</li>

              <li>Fixed missing fields in the pull-down list in the
                conditional find and filter dialog boxes when a rule was
                re-used after a node type change. </li>

              <li>Fixed problems with math fields that reference non-existing
                fields in parent or child nodes.</li>

              <li>Made math fields update properly after node type
                changes.</li>

              <li>Fixed inconsistent updates after renaming fields used with
                bulleted or tabled output.</li>

              <li>Made node copy-paste and drag-and-drop work when the initial
                selection includes both parent and child nodes. </li>

              <li>When importing a tabbed text file with multiple top-level
                nodes, create a single higher-level node to prevent
                failure.</li>

              <li>Fixed the availability of the move up button in the
                customize toolbar dialog when the second command in the list
                is selected.</li>

            </ul>

              Config pane of the Configure Data Types dialog.  Each line of
              the output format becomes a column.  Any text at the start of

              heading.</li>

              <li>An option to add bullets to the output of child nodes was

              <li>The keyboard entry of dates and times into fields was made
              more flexible by allowing entries such as 4-digit years that
              don't exactly match the entry format.</li>

              <li>Any text selection is now used as the default name for links
              inserted into text fields.</li>

              <li>Links to local named anchors in a node's HTML text content
              now work if they don't conflict with any node unique IDs.</li>

              <li>Problems with undoing the dragging and dropping of a node
              were fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Major New Features Since 1.2.x:</b>

              <li>Different files can be open in multiple TreeLine windows
              within the same TreeLine session. This is controlled with
              commands in the new "Window" menu.</li>

              <li>The "Window-&gt;New Window" command creates a new window
              with views of the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window
              are saved in the same document.</li>

              <li>Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or
              command line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it
              is already running.</li>

              <li>An "Add internal link" context menu has been added to text
              boxes in the data editor. It prompts for another node to be
              clicked with the mouse, then an inline internal link is added
              with that node's reference information.</li>

              <li>Added an "HTML directory pages" export option. This will
              export a directory structure with an HTML file for every node. A
              navigation pane on the left side of each page contains links to
              nearby nodes.</li>

              <li>New dialog buttons will restore the default configuration
              when customizing toolbars or shortcuts.</li>

              <li>A new text search function has been added to the help
              viewer.</li>

              bugs. Testing and bug reports are appreciated, but the stable
              release (TreeLine 1.2.x) should be used for critical work.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Added ico and gif as valid tree icon types.</li>

              <li>The French GUI translation has been updated, but the

              <li>Fixed a bug that could cause spell checks to hang.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>June 24, 2010 - Release 1.3.3 (unstable development
            snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It may contain
              bugs. Testing and bug reports are appreciated, but the stable
              release (TreeLine 1.2.x) should be used for critical work.</li>

              <li>German is the only GUI and documentation translation that
              has been updated so far.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A new text search function has been added to the help
              viewer.</li>

              <li>The keyboard shortcuts for scrolling the right-hand views

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The Linux system requirements have been updated to indicate

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>The cascading of new windows has been fixed. It now

              avoids cascading windows off of the screen.</li>

              <li>The Data Editor widgets are now sized correctly when
              TreeLine is started in Data Editor mode.</li>

              snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It may contain
              bugs. Testing and bug reports are appreciated, but the stable
              release (TreeLine 1.2.x) should be used for critical work.</li>

              features.</li>

              <li>The GUI and documentation translations have not yet been
              updated.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Added a menu command that updates another window containing
              the same file (without waiting for a focus change). This command
              also has a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+W).</li>

              <li>A menu option has been added to hide the status bar.  There
              is also a new general option to hide it at startup. A hidden
              status bar is automatically shown temporarily for important
              messages.</li>

              <li>A new button on the toolbar editing dialog will restore the

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Portability on Windows has been improved. A "treeline.ini"
              config file in TreeLine's "lib" directory will be used if it's
              present and there are no config files in the user's application
              data directory.</li>

              <li>The Change Selected Data command has been updated to use
              Data Editor formats for dates and times.</li>

              <li>An alternate TreeLine executable file (treeline_dos.exe) has
              been added to make batch command-line operations work from
              Windows.</li>

              <li>Additional plugin methods have been added for handling files
              and languages.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              when Unicode characters were present.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 14, 2009 - Release 1.3.0 (unstable development
              snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not feature
              complete and probably contains bugs. Testing and bug reports are
              appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine 1.2.x) should be
              used for critical work.</li>

              <li>The documentation has not yet been updated to cover the new
              features.</li>

              <li>The GUI and documentation translations have not yet been
              updated.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Multiple TreeLine windows with different files can be open
              within the same TreeLine session. The "Open files in new
              windows" general option controls whether new windows are used
              when opening or creating files.</li>

              <li>A "Window" menu has been added with commands to create new
              windows, close windows, or select from a list of current
              windows.</li>

              <li>The "Window-&gt;New Window" command creates a new window
              with views of the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window
              are saved in the same document. This can be used to work in
              different sections of the file simultaneously. For performance
              reasons, the non-active window does not show the changes made in
              the active window until the non-active window is focused.</li>

              <li>Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or
              command line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it
              is already running. A new window will be opened if an unopened
              file was specified by file association or in the command
              line.</li>

              <li>An "Add internal link" context menu has been added to text
              boxes in the data editor. It prompts for another node to be
              clicked with the mouse, then an inline internal link is added
              with that node's reference information.</li>

              <li>Added an "HTML directory pages" export option. This will
              export to a directory structure with an HTML file for every
              node. A navigation pane on the left side of each page contains
              links to the node's parent, uncles and children.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The general options dialog has been split into three columns
              for better viewing on small, wide displays.</li>

              <li>Additional export commands and export options have been
              added to the plugin interface.</li>

              <li>To avoid a problem on the Mac platform, when TreeLine is run
              for the first time, it lets the OS determine the window
              position.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 12, 2009 - Release 1.2.4 (stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Added a work-around for a bug in PyQt 4.6's clipboard
              support that can prevent TreeLine from starting.</li>

              <li>Prevent an uncommanded horizontal scrolling to the left of
              the tree view when changing the selection.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>May 5, 2009 - Release 1.2.3 (stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>A new build has been created for use on the Windows 98
              operating system. This fixes problems that made TreeLine
              1.2.2 unusable on Windows 98.</li>

              <li>Data copied to the Windows clipboard is now preserved after
              exiting from TreeLine.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a bug on Windows that showed an error message at
              program exit if the copy command had been used during the
              session.</li>

              <li>In an HTML directories export, characters that are illegal
              in directory names are now correctly removed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>January 8, 2009 - Release 1.2.2 (stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Added German translations of the GUI and the ReadMe
              file.</li>

              <li>Added a few missing strings to the translation files.</li>

              <li>Substituted some imported modules to avoid deprecation
              warnings in Python 2.6. Note that Python 2.3 is no longer
              supported.</li>

              <li>The windows binary has been updated to use Python
              2.6, and the installer has been tweaked to reduce DLL
                conflicts.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed problems using the tab key to change focus from the
              tree to the data editor.</li>

              <li>ID numbers are now properly assigned to new nodes with
              UniqueID fields in the title.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems creating nodes with child count fields in the
              titles.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>November 4, 2008 - Release 1.2.1 (stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fix the loss of entered text when the renaming of a node is
              ended by a command that changes the selected node.</li>

              <li>Problems with opening files with Unicode file names from the
              command line or from a file association have been fixed.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with JPEG and GIF image support in the
              Windows binary build.</li>

              <li>When commands change the tree view, it no longer scrolls
              vertically unless the current node is not visible.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with files set to both compressed and
              encrypted modes. But note that compressing an encrypted file
              still does not significantly reduce its size.</li>

              <li>Problems on the Macintosh platform with detecting the text
              encoding and with setting the default theme have been
              fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>June 17, 2008 - Release 1.2.0 (new stable release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is a new stable release, ending the 1.1.x development
              series.</li>

              <li>This release is only available in English and French. The
              1.0.2 release is still available, including German, Portuguese,
              Russian and Spanish translations. Volunteers to update the
              translations are welcome.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The French translations of the GUI and the ReadMe file have
              been updated.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>When restoring an auto-saved backup file, TreeLine no longer
              replaces a the main file with the backup if the backup is not a
              valid TreeLine file.</li>

              <li>Fixed a minor bug in the Configure Data Types dialog caused
              by unselecting a field in the Output pane.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Major New Features Since 1.0.x:</b>

              <li>TreeLine was extensively rewritten to port it to the Qt4
              library (previous versions used Qt3.x on Linux and Qt2.3 on
              Windows). Benefits include updated widgets and removal of the
              non-commercial license exception in Windows.</li>

              <li>Preformatted templates have been added for new TreeLine
              documents. User-created templates can also be added.</li>

              <li>The content of right-hand views varies based on the
              selection and other options. A single selection still shows
              panes with the parent and its children, but a multiple selection
              will show all of the selected nodes in a single pane. Also, the
              Data Output view can optionally show an indented view of all
              descendants, and the Data Editor view splits the display into
              pages to speed up display.</li>

              <li>More commands can make use of a multiple selection instead
              of just using the single active node. Also, an option can set
              the sequence of showing and exporting multiple selections to
              either tree order or selection order.</li>

              <li>There is a tab on the left-hand view for a flat node list
              showing the selected nodes and all of their descendants. It is
              most useful for showing the results of filtering. There is a
              conditional filter for specific rules and a text filter that
              searches all fields for a string.</li>

              <li>Several dialogs have been reworked for usability. The
              Configure Data Types and Print Options dialogs use tabs for
              better organization. The Configure dialog also has initially
              hidden advanced features and is now modeless, so it can be left
              open while applying configuration changes. The Sort, Export and
              Print Preview dialogs have also been updated.</li>

              <li>Navigation through the tree is simplified by new commands
              that step through the selection history. Also, search strings
              are now highlighted in the Data Output view for text
              searches.</li>

              <li>New dialogs have been added to customize keyboard shortcuts
              and tool bar buttons. There is also a directory for user-defined
              tree icons.</li>

              <li>New file import and export options convert between an
              outline and an Open Document Format (ODF) text document,
              compatible with OpenOffice.org and KWord. Formatting is not
              maintained.</li>

              <li>A Unique ID field type has been added that is automatically
              loaded with unique numbers. It is useful for link
              references.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>January 15, 2008 - Release 1.1.10 (unstable development
                snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is nearly ready
              to become a stable release, but it could still contain bugs.
              Testing and bug reports are appreciated.</li>

              <li>The French translation of the GUI is the only one completed
              so far. None of the documentation translations have been
              updated.</li>

              <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or higher
              and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages may not be
              available yet for these libraries in some distributions.</li>

              <li>If you've installed previous development releases, it is
              recommended that you delete the old configuration file
              ("~/.treeline-1.1/treelinerc" on Linux, "Documents and
              Settings\&lt;login&gt;\Application
              Data\bellz\treeline-1.1\treeline.ini" on Windows) before running
              this release.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Exporting to HTML directories has been improved. The file
              names are generated from the reference field (were from the
              first field). Internal links to nodes now work properly in the
              exported files.</li>

              <li>When saving a new file, the Save-As dialog now defaults to
              the top directory in the recent file list.</li>

              <li>A translation of the GUI in French is now available.  The
              i18n installation file is a separate download.</li>

              <li>The ReadMe documentation file has been updated to clarify
              certain usage issues.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>The other controls in the configuration dialog are updated
              immediately when setting a data type to be derived from a
              generic.</li>

              <li>A recent file list bug that affected the httpload plugin has
              been fixed. Also, a library need by the plugin (urllib) has been
              added to the Windows installation.</li>

              The dialog is also shown at startup if the recent file list is
              empty. Default templates are installed into TreeLine library
              directories. New templates can be added to a user templates
              directory in the user settings location.  Template file names

              updated.</li>

              <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or higher
              and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are not yet
              available for these libraries in some distributions.</li>

              this release.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A new command (View-&gt;Show Output Descendants) toggles the
              Data Output child view from showing only child nodes to showing
              an indented view of all descendant nodes. A button was added to
              the default toolbar for this command. Also, a new general option
              can make the descendant view the default at startup.</li>

              <li>A new file export option converts an outline to an Open
              Document Format (ODF) text document, compatible with
              OpenOffice.org and KWord. The title of each node is assigned a
              heading style at the appropriate level. Any other text in the
              output of each node becomes normal text under the heading. Any
              HTML formatting is stripped.</li>

              <li>ODF text documents can be imported. The node structure is
              based on the heading styles assigned in the document. Any text
              under each heading is assigned to that heading's node.
              Formatting is not maintained.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>New commands were added to the Data Editor context menus
              that open the Configure Data Types dialog with the editor's type
              and/or field already selected.</li>

              <li>Keyboard shortcuts were added for the commands that add HTML
              tags in the Data Editor. Icons were also added to these
              commands, so the toolbar editor can be used to place them on a
              toolbar if desired.</li>

              <li>The interface for writing plugin modules was improved by
              adding interfaces to the keyboard shortcut editor and the
              toolbar editor. Also, a plugin interface to get the plugin's
              directory was added.</li>

              <li>Any default text for new fields is added when a node's data
              type is changed (not just to a new node), as long as there isn't
              already data in a field with the same name.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a problem with the automatic opening of the last file
              used if there are no valid recent files.</li>

              <li>Fixed a crash at file open if the file's owner is not found
              in a Linux machine's user password database.</li>

              <li>Issues with the display of text have been fixed if the Qt
              library being used is version 4.2.3 or greater (the Windows
              build now uses 4.2.3). These issues showed up when scroll bars
              were shown and could hide the right edge of the text or the last
              line.</li>

              <li>Multiple issues with dragging or pasting nodes between
              sessions of TreeLine were fixed.</li>

              <li>If the Configure Data Types dialog is open, it is properly
              updated after the use of the undo command.</li>

              <li>The find dialog is properly focused when repeatedly
              shown.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems occurring when attempting to print an empty
              branch or an empty selection.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with the export of HTML directories. It now
              removes illegal characters from directory names created from
              field contents.</li>

              <li>Auto choice fields are now properly updated after
              configuration changes.</li>

              <li>A missing help menu was added to the Unique ID field format
              editor.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>March 8, 2007 - Release 1.0.1 (stable bug-fix release)</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>A Russian translation of the GUI and ReadMe file has been
              added. As a result, there are now six supported languages
              (English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish).</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a problem using drag &amp; drop on a node with a
              conditional type.</li>

              <li>Avoid problems caused by using the Edit-&gt;Cut command with
              the root node included in the selection.</li>

              <li>The importing of files with bad Unicode characters has been
              improved.</li>

            this release.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A Unique ID field type has been added. The field is
              automatically loaded with unique numbers. Initially, the field's
              format string is set to the desired first number in the series,
              with optional leading zeros and optional leading or trailing
              characters. All nodes of the data type will get an automatically
              assigned ID. The field format string will always show the next
              available number, which will be given to the next new node of
              that type.</li>

              <li>The node sorting commands have been consolidated into a
              single new dialog. This provides more options for selecting what
              to sort (all nodes, branches, children or siblings) and how (by
              types and fields or by titles).</li>

              <li>An option has been added to the numbering dialog to only
              number nodes where the number field already exists. This allows
              node types in the branch that do not have the number field to be
              skipped.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The tree view no longer scrolls horizontally when the
              selection is changed.</li>

              <li>The focus behavior of the Data Editor view has been tweaked
              to allow easier tabbing between widgets.</li>

              <li>Clicking on a selected node to rename it is now disabled
              when multiple nodes are selected. This avoids initiating a
              rename when the intent was to modify a multiple selection.</li>

              <li>The Insert Sibling Before command has been added to the node
              right-click context menu for consistency.</li>

              <li>The Spell Check dialog is no longer hidden and re-shown
              between each misspelled word, resulting in smoother
              operation.</li>

              <li>The Output tab of the Configure Data Types dialog has been
              adjusted to avoid changing the dialog size when toggling the
              advanced options.</li>

              <li>The fonts in the Print Options dialog are sorted case
              insensitively, and the size of the dialog is fixed regardless of
              the selected font.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a crash when opening a file with the flat view
              shown.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems occurring when the number of toolbars was set
              to zero.</li>

              <li>Fixed undo operations for Numbering, data Add Category Level
              and Arrange by Reference commands.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with undo and delete commands issued while a
              node is being renamed.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with renaming data types and fields in the
              Configure Data Types dialog.</li>

              <li>Avoid adding duplicate types to Other Field References in
              the advanced Output tab of the Configure Data Types dialog.</li>

              <li>No longer allow the Edit Cut command to operate if the root
              node is selected.</li>

              <li>Fixed a freeze of the spell checker on some platforms.</li>

              <li>An empty rectangle that was sometimes shown on the status
              line at the bottom of the main window has been removed.</li>

              <li>An occasional problem with the import of generic XML was
              fixed.</li>

              <li>The importing of files with bad Unicode characters has been
              improved.</li>

              <li>The restoring of tree states when opening a file has been
              made more robust.</li>

              <li>Fixed several other minor tracebacks that can show up in a
              terminal or log file.</li>

              updated.</li>

              <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or higher
              and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are not yet
              available for these libraries in some distributions.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Previous and Next Selection commands have been added to the
              View menu. These commands step through a history of tree
              selections for quicker navigation.</li>

              <li>When using the Find command with the Data Output view
              visible, the search string occurrences are highlighted in the
              output. Note: in Linux, this feature requires Qt v4.2 or greater
              and PyQt v4.1 or greater.</li>

              <li>An icons directory has been added to the user configuration
              directory ("~/.treeline-1.1/icons" on Linux, "Documents and
              Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\bellz\treeline-1.1\icons"
              on Windows). Image files (PNG or BMP) placed into this directory
              are available for use as tree icons.</li>

              <li>"Move First" and "Move Last" commands have been added to the
              Edit menu. These commands move a child node to be the first or
              last child of its parent.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Horizontal scrolling of the tree view when the contents are
              wide is now supported.</li>

              <li>The non-interactive command line options have been ported
              from the stable version. These options allow batch processing of
              file imports and exports.</li>

              <li>Support for plugin extension modules has been ported from
              the stable version. The interfaces to TreeLine functions are
              unchanged, but existing plugins will need to be ported to the
              Qt4 library. An updated version of the httpLoad plugin is
              available.</li>

              <li>A plugins directory has been added to the user configuration
              directory. This allows plugin installation without elevated
              privileges.</li>

              <li>The code required to support GUI translations has been
              ported from the stable version, but the actual translations have
              not yet been updated.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>The problem with cut/copy/paste operations in Windows that
              produced an error message at application exit was fixed.</li>

              <li>Fixed several problems with the undo of changes to the Data
              Type Configuration.</li>

              <li>A bug that could sometimes add an extra node during renaming
              in the Tree View has been fixed.</li>

              <li>Problems encountered when typing a replacement word during
              spell check have been fixed.</li>

              <li>A spell check language setting in File Options that is not
              available on the system is now ignored.</li>

            </ul>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not feature
              complete and is sure to contain bugs. Testing and bug reports
              are appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine
              1.0.0) should be used for any critical work.</li>

              <li>Some features from the stable release are not yet
              implemented here. These include command line options, plugin
              support and translation support. Also, the documentation has not
              been updated.</li>

              <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or higher
              and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are not yet
              available for these libraries in some distributions.</li>

              <li>One known bug in the Windows version produces an error
              message at application exit if cut/copy/paste operations were
              done during the session.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A new built-in editor for keyboard shortcuts has been added
              to the Tools menu. It has two tabs: one for menu commands and
              one for other commands. Simply press the desired key combination
              to change the shortcut in the selected entry.  In general,
              printable characters without Ctrl or Alt modifiers should not be
              used for shortcuts.  Although the editor will accept them, they
              may not work properly when certain widgets are focused.</li>

              <li>A dialog to customize the tool bars has been added. It is
              accessed from the Tools menu. This allows the user to select
              small or large icons, define the number of tool bars, and define
              the commands included in each tool bar.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The saving of node open/close states for recently opened
              files has been ported from the stable version.</li>

              <li>The restoring of splitter sizes and the active right-hand
              tab from the previous session has been ported from the stable
              version.</li>

              <li>The TreeLine configuration files now include a version
              number (.treeline-1.1 on Linux, treeline-1.1.ini on Windows) to
              avoid incompatibility issues with previous versions.</li>

              <li>The default non-menu keyboard shortcuts have been changed to
              control-key sequences that function regardless of the focused
              widget.</li>

              <li>The incremental node title search has been ported from the
              stable version. The default keyboard shortcut is now
              Ctrl+/.</li>

              <li>The option to add a node when pressing the enter key has
              been ported from the stable version.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Searching for nodes with the flat view active now only finds
              nodes actually present in the flat view.</li>

              <li>Problems with drag &amp; drop of nodes with Unicode content
              were fixed.</li>

              <li>The Icon Selection dialog under Configure Data Types now
              scrolls to the currently selected icon when opened.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>November 22, 2006 - Release 1.1.2 (unstable development

              <li>All of the notes listed for Version 1.1.1 still apply.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a serious bug that caused TreeLine to crash when using
              a pull-down combo box on a field in the Data Editor view.</li>

              split locations and active tabs are not yet available. And the
              documentation has not been updated.</li>

              <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or higher

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Printing functionality has been added to the development
              series. It now includes options to print the entire tree, the
              selected branches, or just the selected nodes.</li>

              <li>A new Print Options dialog box is tabbed to give easier
              access to all of the options. There are buttons that give a more
              logical progression from the options to the print preview and to
              the print dialog.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The buttons at the bottom of the Configure Data Types dialog
              have been changed to OK/Apply/Reset/Cancel. This can reduce the
              number of mouse clicks.</li>

              <li>The Configure Data Types dialog now defaults to the selected
              node's type when it is shown.</li>

              <li>On Windows, the TreeLine.ini file has been moved from the
              installation directory to a location under the "Documents and
              Settings" folder. This avoids problems on multi-user systems and
              for users with limited access rights.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>The Configure Data Types dialog now updates properly after
              copying types from another file, adding numbering, and
              rearranging by category and reference.</li>

              <li>Various problems with node drag &amp; drop that could result
              in inadvertent drops were fixed.</li>

              <li>A bug that caused the right-hand view splitter to reset to
              even sizes was fixed.</li>

              <li>Problems with saving changes to the format of file
              information fields were fixed.</li>

            <h2>September 15, 2006 - Translation Updates</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>Spanish and Portuguese translations of the GUI and ReadMe
              file have been added for the stable version of TreeLine.  A typo
              in the German translation was also fixed.  The French
              translation remains unchanged.</li>

              <li>The httpload plugin has been updated with French, German,
              Spanish and Portuguese translations.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>September 12, 2006 - Release 1.1.0 (unstable development
                snapshot)</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not feature
              complete and is sure to contain bugs. Testing and bug reports
              are appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine 1.0.0) should
              be used for any critical work.</li>

              <li>Several features from the stable release are not yet
              implemented here. These include printing, keyboard shortcuts for
              non-menu items, command line options, plugin support and
              translation support. Also, restoring of tree node open/close
              states, window split locations and active tabs are not yet
              available. And the documentation has not been updated.</li>

              <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or higher
              and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are not yet
              available for these libraries in some distributions.</li>

              <li>One known bug in the Windows version produces an error
              message at application exit if cut/copy/paste operations were
              done during the session.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>TreeLine was ported to the Qt4 library. This involved a
              major rewrite of the code. The previous versions used Qt3.x on
              Linux and Qt2.3 on Windows. Benefits include updated widgets and
              removal of the non-commercial license exception in Windows.</li>

              <li>The Configure Data Types dialog uses tabs for better
              organization. Many tabs contain advanced features that can be
              shown if desired. The dialog is also modeless, so it can be left
              open while applying configuration changes.</li>

              <li>The content of the right-hand view varies based on the kinds
              of nodes selected. With a single parent node selected, it splits
              the view, showing the parent and its children (same as version
              1.0.0). With a multiple selection or with a childless node
                selected, it shows all of the selected nodes in a single
                pane.</li>

              <li>A general option sets the sequence for multiple selection to
              either tree order or selected order. When nodes are selected
              with control-click under the selected order option, they show in
              the right-hand view in the order they were picked. This sequence
              also applies to copy and export commands.</li>

              <li>More commands make use of a multiple selection instead of
              just using the single active node. For example, the paste
              command will add duplicate children under each selected
              destination node.</li>

              <li>The export command includes options to export the entire
              tree, the selected branches, or just the selected nodes.</li>

              <li>In order to render the Data Editor right-hand view faster,
              there is a general option to set the number of "pages" initially
              shown. By default, only one page is shown.  Buttons allow
              toggling to the next page or all pages.</li>

              <li>There is a tab on the left-hand view to show a flat node
              list. It shows the initially selected nodes and all of their
              descendants. It is probably most useful when using filtering
              commands.</li>

              <li>A conditional filter selects nodes based on rules for
              specific data types and fields, and a text filter selects based
              on finding the given text in any field. Both filters show their
              results in the tabbed "Flat View" and remain in effect until
              removed.</li>

              <li>In the advanced mode, a child count field reference can be
              added to the output configuration. It shows the number of
              children at a specified descendant level.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>July 6, 2006 - Release 1.0.0</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>A new version numbering system is being introduced. This
              release is 1.0.0, to better indicate its stability. The 1.1.x
              series will be started soon for less stable development
              releases.</li>

              <li>The German translation of the ReadMe file has been
              updated.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a problem with duplicate nodes showing up when pasting
              multiple nodes on Windows.</li>

              <li>Deriving types from other derived types is no longer
              allowed, since it did not function properly.</li>

              <li>A problem with saving an encrypted file in the German
              version of TreeLine has been fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>February 16, 2006 - Release 0.14.1</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Exported XSLT files now support field prefixes and suffixes.
              Thanks to Roland Meister for supplying patches.</li>

              <li>Added functions to the plugin interface to allow plugins to
              open and close nodes.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a problem with displaying output from fields with
              non-ASCII characters in their names.</li>

              <li>Auto save now works properly with encrypted files.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>The French and German UI translation files and the French
              ReadMe files have been updated, but the German ReadMe files are
              not complete (but still usable).  Updated files will be made
              available soon.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>December 20, 2005 - Release 0.14.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Data types can be set to derive their field settings from a
              generic type. This allows types with different output formatting
              to always use the same field data. Any changes to the generic's
              list of fields and field types are automatically reflected in
              the fields of all derived types.  A derived option can be
              selected when copying a type, or a generic type can be specified
              from the derived type's "Advanced Configuration" dialog
              box.</li>

              <li>Conditional expressions can be used to automatically assign
              a data type based on each node's content. Conditions are
              assigned to a generic type and its associated derived types.
              This allows the automatic assignment of different output
              formatting or different icons depending on each node's field
              data. Conditions are specified from each type's "Advanced
              Configuration" dialog box. Conditions do not have to be set for
              all types in a family, since, if no conditions are true for a
              node, the program will select a blank condition over a false
              one. In addition, conditions that are always "True" or "False"
              are available to toggle the output format of all nodes of a
              certain type simultaneously by modifying the condition.</li>

              <li>By default, the spell check uses dictionaries for the
              current operating system language. A new option under
              "Tools-&gt;File Options" can be used to specify an alternate
              two-letter language code for the current TreeLine file. This
              only works with aspell and with the appropriate aspell
              dictionaries available.</li>

              <li>A new menu item, "File-&gt;Open Sample", is a shortcut to
              the directory containing sample template files.</li>

              <li>A new menu item, "Help-&gt;Help Contents", directly opens
              the "Using TreeLine" section of the ReadMe file.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>When changing a node's type, if the result would have been a
              blank title, TreeLine now adjusts the new title fields to
              maintain the original title text.</li>

              <li>Picture links with relative paths now resolve their
              reference based on the directory containing the current TreeLine
              file.</li>

              <li>When applying a font tag in the editor view, the selection
              is maintained. This allows multiple tags to be applied.</li>

              <li>HTML tags in field prefixes and suffixes are now removed in
              node titles.</li>

              <li>Exported HTML has been made somewhat more compliant with
              standards.</li>

              <li>A new option on the windows installer toggles the writing of
              installation directory and uninstall information to the
              registry. When this and other options are disabled, TreeLine can
              be installed without modifying the registry.</li>

              <li>Four more sample files have been included. These files
              provide examples of using TreeLine's features and can be used as
              templates.</li>

              <li>The ReadMe file has been updated with descriptions of the
              sample files, with more internal links, and with
              screenshots.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>A problem with saving reference field settings for unused
              node types was fixed.</li>

              <li>Formats copied from another file are now available
              immediately.</li>

              <li>Node titles from HTML-enabled fields that contain escaped
              characters (&lt;, &gt;, &amp;) are now properly displayed.</li>

              <li>Fixed some minor bugs concerning setting the default field
              value for new nodes.</li>

              <li>A problem with exporting HTML directories with very recent
              versions of the PyQt library was fixed.</li>

              <li>When displaying child data in node output, extra separators
              between blank entries are no longer shown.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>The French and German UI translation files have been
              updated, but the French and German ReadMe files are not complete
              (but still usable).  Updated files will be made available
              soon.</li>

            <h2>November 4, 2005 - German Translation Update</h2>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>Updated German translations are now available on the
              download page.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>November 1, 2005 - Release 0.13.1</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>The number of recently used files listed in the File menu
              can be set using a new general option. Note that this also
              controls how many files have their tree states (open/closed
              nodes, etc.) saved.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>TreeLine now sets the interface language using the LANG
              environment variable (if set) before falling back to other
              locale settings. This allows the operating system's locale
              settings to be overridden.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Problems starting TreeLine when the locale's LANG variable
              ends with "@euro" have been fixed.</li>

              <li>Problems with the display of the rename edit box when
              creating new nodes in a long, scrolled tree view have been
              fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Notes:</b>

              <li>The French translation files have been updated, but the
              German files are not complete (but still usable).  Updated files
              will be made available soon.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>August 29, 2005 - Release 0.13.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>The TreeLine user interface and documentation have been
              internationalized. Currently, translations are available for
              French and German. Volunteers to translate into additional
              languages are welcome.</li>

              <li>Number formats can be internationalized. Periods and commas
              are supported as radix characters, and commas, periods or spaces
              can be set as thousands separators.</li>

              <li>A new general option can set printing units to either inches
              or centimeters.</li>

              <li>An external editor can be invoked from a Data Editor text
              field context menu. The EDITOR environment variable can be used
              to specify the editor to start, or, if the variable doesn't
              exist, TreeLine will prompt for an executable to set as the
              default.</li>
              
            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>The general option for a number editing format has been
              removed. Instead, the output format is displayed in the editor.
              Of course, any new entry with a reasonable format is correctly
              interpreted (but the correct radix character must be used).</li>

              <li>Handling of spaces in filenames for the linking fields have
              been improved. Paths with spaces selected in the file browser
              are properly quoted (Windows) or escaped (Linux).</li>

              <li>Page Up/Down commands in the Data Output view now leave a
              one-line overlap.</li>

              <li>A Ctrl-C interrupt in a terminal is now ignored.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>A dummy field has been added to imported bookmark separator
              formats to avoid configuration problems.</li>

              <li>Paths in links to XSLT files are now properly handled when
              not in the same directory as the XML file.</li>

              <li>Format text is now immediately updated when renaming
              fields.</li>

              <li>Problems with undo after complex data changes have been
              fixed.</li>

              <li>Errors due to having ASCII control characters in TreeLine
              text have been fixed.</li>

              <li>Problems with spell check of unicode characters have been
              fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>May 4, 2005 - Release 0.12.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A new AutoChoice field type provides pull-down selection of
              previously used entries. Any new entries are automatically added
              to the pull-down.</li>

              <li>A new ExecuteLink field type runs an external program when
              its link is clicked. The command to run is given by the text of
              the field. Or the field's prefix may contain the program name,
              so that the field's text is used for arguments or file names.
              There is also a general option to disable these links when
              security is a concern.</li>

              <li>A button that brings up a file browsing dialog has been
              added to the editor for Path, ExecuteLink and Picture field
              types.</li>

              <li>Link fields can display alternate text in place of the
              target URL. This is done by specifying an alternate text field
              in the Advanced Field Format dialog.</li>

              <li>Fields from child nodes can be embedded in their parent's
              output. Select a child reference from the Other Fields dialog.
              The child data is delimited with a separator string defined as a
              file option.</li>

              <li>A new file option allows the removal of line breaks from
              each output line. This allows other HTML tags to be used to
              separate the output lines.</li>

              <li>A "contains" rule to check for substrings has been added to
              the rules for node filtering and selective type changes.</li>

              <li>The right-hand view that was previously used is now selected
              automatically on startup. This can be disabled using the general
              restore window geometry option.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Toolbar and tree icons are loaded from individual PNG files
              instead of from an XPM file. This improves icon quality.</li>

              <li>Some features from the dialogs for data types and fields
              have been moved to advanced dialogs for simplicity.</li>

              <li>Unicode characters are accepted for first-letter tree
              searches.</li>

              <li>All calls to the eval() function have been replaced for
              improved security. Thanks to Roland Meister for providing
              patches.</li>

              <li>The HTML version of the ReadMe file is now exported from the
              TreeLine version.</li>

              <li>Spaces are permitted in Linux command line arguments.</li>

              <li>Qt command line options are supported.</li>

              <li>There have been several minor improvements to the plugin
              module interface.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>A serious problem with deleting the last child under the
              root item has been fixed.</li>

              <li>Some keyboard shortcuts for incremental searching have been
              fixed.</li>

              <li>Open nodes are restored more consistently when opening
              files.</li>

              <li>A font issue on early versions of Qt3 has been fixed.</li>

              <li>The search for dtd files linked from XML files has been
              disabled to eliminate errors.</li>

              <li>Visibility problems with long unbroken text lines in data
              editors have been fixed in Qt3.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>February 16, 2005 - Release 0.11.1</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a compatibility issue in the toolbar code that would
              prevent TreeLine from starting when PyQt was built against the
              newest versions of the sip library (versions 4.2rc1 and
              4.2rc2).</li>

              <li>Problems with editing the data of combination field types
              have been fixed.</li>

              <li>A bug in the plugin interface for setting field formats has
              been fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>February 4, 2005 - Release 0.11.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Icons have been added to the tree view.  The icon assigned
              to each data type can be changed from the Configure Data Types
              dialog box.  There are several generic icons available within
              TreeLine, and plugin modules can be written to add additional
              ones.  A general option to disable the tree icons has also been
              added.</li>

              <li>A command has been added to the data menu to copy type
              formatting from another TreeLine file.  All types from the
              chosen file are copied.  Any types in the current file with a
              matching name are overwritten, but types with unique names are
              retained.</li>

              <li>Functions to import and export generic XML files have been
              added.  These routines do not have much intelligence - each XML
              element becomes a node and each XML attribute becomes a field.
              This lets TreeLine function as a crude XML editor.</li>

              <li>An editor height parameter has been added to text fields.
              This allows the number of lines in the data editor to be set for
              each field in each data type.  As a result, the LongText field
              type becomes redundant and has been removed.</li>

              <li>A field parameter has been added for fields that are
              required to be filled.  Fields with this parameter set are
              marked with an asterisk in the data editor view.</li>

              <li>Another field parameter has been added to allow certain
              fields to be hidden in the data editor view.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>A fair amount of TreeLine code has been rewritten to improve
              efficiency and to ease future changes.  Users should see
              improved speed with large files, especially noticeable when
              repainting during editing.</li>

              <li>TreeLine now requires Python Version 2.3 or higher on Linux
              systems.  The previous version of TreeLine will remain available
              for those stuck with older versions of Python.</li>

              <li>HTML tags are now stripped from node titles in the left-hand
              tree view if the fields are set to output HTML rich text.</li>

              <li>The plugin extension module interface has been expanded.
              Several added functions deal with node and field formatting.
              There is also a new callback trigger called whenever a node's
              data is modified.</li>

              <li>A user plugin directory can now be specified in the
              configuration file.  This allows plugins to be installed without
              root/administrator access.</li>

              <li>An option has been added to the Linux installer to allow a
              different documentation directory to be specified.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a drag-and-drop bug that wouldn't allow nodes to be
              moved instead of copied in the Linux version.</li>

              <li>Fixed the output of fields that include dashes and periods
              in their names.</li>

              <li>A problem retaining the font setting for edit views has been
              fixed.</li>

              <li>A rare startup failure due to problems with the encryption
              engine has been fixed.</li>

              <li>A rare problem with foreign language encodings has been
              fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>November 8, 2004 - Release 0.10.2</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a major bug that could prevent new nodes that contain
              date or time fields from being created.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 28, 2004 - Release 0.10.1</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a major bug that caused TreeLine to hang when
              attempting to open a recent file that no longer exists.  This
              bug also caused startup failures if automatic opening was
              enabled with nonexistent files.</li>

              <li>A bug in the plugin interface's getRootNode function was
              fixed.</li>

              <li>Fixed a problem with file encryption on 64-bit systems.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 15, 2004 - Release 0.10.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>One of the fields in a data type can be tagged as a
              reference field in the field-type dialog box. It defaults to the
              first field.  This field is now used as the reference for the
              arrange and flatten by reference commands. It is also used by
              the new internal link feature, described below.</li>

              <li>There is a new internal link field type. It creates a
              clickable link in the Data Output window that selects the next
              node with matching text in its reference field. If link or
              reference fields contain multiple lines, each line is treated as
              a separate link or reference, respectively. If desired, the same
              field can be used as both the link and reference fields, so that
              clicking on a keyword in one node's field selects the next node
              that also has that keyword.  If exported to HTML, the internal
              links function as links to page anchors, but, in cases with
              duplicate references, they only find the uppermost reference on
              the page instead of the next one.</li>

              <li>File encryption has been added as an option to password
              protect TreeLine files.  Individual files can be set to
              encrypted mode from either "Tools-&gt;File Options" or from the
              save-as dialog.  There is also a general option to set the
              default for new files.  The encryption uses the SHA hash
              function as a stream cipher - it should be fairly secure.</li>

              <li>A default initial field value can now be specified for a
              field type.  Any new nodes get this value for the given data
              field when they are created.  Also, in date and time fields, an
              initial value of "Now" can be used to get a time-stamp of node
              creation.</li>

              <li>An interface to plugin extension modules has been added to
              TreeLine.  This allows extensions to be written by various
              coders that provide functionality needed by a few users without
              adding bloat to the main application.  Currently available
              plugins are listed on the "Downloads" page of the TreeLine web
              site.  The plugins are installed by copying their Python file
              (*.py) to the plugins directory
              ("&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/treeline/plugins/" on Linux or
              "TreeLine\lib\plugins\" on Windows).  A list of loaded plugins
              can be found using the "Help-&gt;About Plugins" command.
              Information about writing plugins can be found in the
              "plugininterface.py" file in the TreeLine source code.</li>

              <li>Options have been added under "Tools-&gt;General Options" to
              set the fonts used for the tree view and for the right-pane
              editor views.</li>

              <li>When printing, TreeLine will now avoid breaking pages
              between a parent and its first child.  This behavior can be
              disabled by changing the "Keep first child with parent" print
              option.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Unicode text handling has been improved. Unicode can now be
              used in TreeLine file names, node data type names and field
              names. Also, imported and exported text files now use the proper
              encoding based on the system's locale settings.</li>

              <li>A new sample TreeLine file with internal link fields has
              been added to the documentation.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>An occasional problem bringing up the field-type dialog for
              file-info fields was fixed.</li>

            <h2>September 9, 2004 - New Mailing List</h2>

            <p>A mailing list has been created for users to discuss anything
            and everything about TreeLine.  This is the place for development
            discussions (from roadmaps to feature suggestions to beta
            testing), release announcements, bug reports, and general user
            discussions (from new uses to tips &amp; tricks to configuration
            samples).</p>

            <p>To subscribe, go to <a
                href="http://bellz.org/mailman/listinfo/treeline"> this
                page</a>.  I expect this to be a low-volume mailing list.</p>


            <h2>September 1, 2004 - Release 0.9.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Import and export of bookmarks in both the Mozilla HTML
              format (Mozilla, Firefox and Netscape browsers) and the XBEL
              format (Konqueror, Galeon and Elinks browsers) have been
              added.</li>

              <li>An new option exports a portion of a tree to another
              TreeLine file.</li>

              <li>Command line options have been added to allow
              non-interactive file importing and exporting.  This allows
              automated runs to be scheduled.  For more details, run "treeline
              -h" from the command line.  If using a windows binary, output is
              supressed, so it must be directed to a log file ("treeline -h
              &gt; log.txt").</li>

              <li>Options have been added to work with compressed TreeLine
              files.  Individual files can be set to compressed mode from
              either "Tools-&gt;File Options" or from the save-as dialog.
              There is also a general option to set the default for new files.
              Thanks to Mathieu Girard for contributing code.</li>

              <li>A field reference to show data from any ancestor node has
              been added.  The closest one with a matching field is used.</li>

              <li>Fields containing file meta-data have been added.  These
              include file name, path, size, and modified time.</li>

              <li>Headers and footers for printing have been added.  They can
              contain the file meta-data mentioned above.  The headers and
              footers can also be shown in exported HTML files.</li>

              <li>HTML character formatting tags can be automatically added to
              text using a new data editor context menu.  Available tags
              include bold, italics, underline, size and color.  Note that the
              fields must be set to display HTML content for this to be
              effective.</li>

              <li>A new general option makes new fields default to HTML
              content.  This allows for easier display of HTML formatting.
              This option is not enabled by default, since it does not
              preserve carriage returns and does not show non-escaped "&lt;",
              "&gt;" and "&amp;" symbols.</li>

              <li>When opening a recently used file, TreeLine will now restore
              the states of open and selected nodes.  If desired, this feature
              can be disabled with a new general option.  Thanks to Jan Hustak
              for contributing this code.</li>

              <li>The toolbar has been split into two separate bars (general
              commands and node commands) that can be shown and moved
              independently.  Again, thanks to Jan Hustak for contributing
              this code.</li>

              <li>A new auto-save feature stores unsaved files with a "~"
              appended to the name.  The backup files are automatically
              removed when the file is saved or TreeLine exits cleanly.  The
              auto-save time interval is set in the general options.</li>

              <li>New key bindings, set to Shift+Page-Up and Shift+Page-Down
              by default, scroll the current right-hand child view.</li>

              <li>The XSL export command now prompts for the name of an
              optional style sheet (css).  This name is stored in the TreeLine
              file as the default for future exports.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>There have been some general improvements to the handling of
              imported and exported files.</li>

              <li>File option settings can now be restored with undo/redo
              commands.</li>

              <li>The README documentation files have been revised to be more
              organized and readable.</li>

              <li>More sample files are provided.  See the "sample_*.trl"
              files in the "doc" directory of the installation.</li>

              <li>The Linux install script now includes an option for a
              temporary build root directory.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>The up-arrow key binding did not work as expected in a
              deeply nested tree.</li>

              <li>Some problems with auto-completion on data editor combo
              boxes have been fixed.</li>

              <li>Problems in windows with some option spin boxes accepting
              new values have been fixed.</li>

              <li>Fixed a compatibility issue with older versions of
              Python.</li>

            </ul>

              (3.0.x).</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>June 3, 2004 - Release 0.8.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Added undo and redo commands and an option for the number of
              undo levels that are stored.</li>

              <li>Added the ability to show parent and grandparent data within
              a node's formatted output.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>When changing node types with the menu, check marks now show
              the current type(s).</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed crashes caused by right-clicking in the edit area or
              using the Alt-Tab key combination when renaming a node
              title.</li>

              <li>Fixed problems occurring when several similar data type
              names were defined.</li>

              <li>A rare problem with the installation script choking on image
              thumbnail directories was fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>May 18, 2004 - Release 0.7.3</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Spell checking of the tree data has been implemented.  This
              feature requires an external program, either aspell or ispell
              (see the System Requirements section).</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

            </ul>

            <h2>April 1, 2004 - Release 0.7.2</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>For faster keyboard navigation, the left arrow key now
              closes the selected node's parent if the selected node has no
              children or is already closed.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Some tree item drag-and-drop bugs have been fixed.</li>

              does not show children.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>March 2, 2004 - Release 0.7.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Added prefix and suffix tag formatting for groups of
              siblings.  These tags allow output to be formatted in tables or
              with bullets.  See the "sample_table.trl" file for an example of
              table formatting.</li>

              <li>The size and position of the window and its splitters are
              now saved at exit.  A new option will disable this feature if

            </ul>

            <h2>November 19, 2003 - Release 0.6.2</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

            </ul>

            <h2>November 7, 2003 - Release 0.6.1</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Incremental searching has been improved by adding keyboard
              commands to repeat the search forward (F3 by default) and
              backward (Shift-F3 by default).</li>

              <li>The sorting commands now contain options for reverse
              sorting.</li>

              <li>The importing of text files has been improved.  Imports of
              plain text were added, with items for each line or each
              paragraph.  A prompt for the type of text file was also
              added.</li>

              <li>A new option setting avoids going into title renaming mode
              when adding a new node.  This also keeps the selection unchanged
              as nodes are added.</li>

              <li>Dragging files to the TreeLine window in order to open them
              is now supported.</li>

            </ul>

              item's type is initially selected.</li>

              <li>A TreeLine formatted version of the ReadMe file has been
              added.</li>

              <li>An install script was added for Linux and Unix systems.</li>

              <li>The windows build now uses Python version 2.3 and PyQt
              version 3.8.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Keyboard commands are disabled during tree rename operations
              to avoid unpredictable results.</li>

              <li>The right views now update properly when the parent of the
              selected tree item is closed.</li>

              <li>Problems involving copying with multiple nodes selected were
              fixed.</li>

              <li>Problems with drag-and-drop on some Linux systems were
              fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>September 16, 2003 - Release 0.6.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>The three right views are now divided into upper sections
              for the selection's data and lower sections for the data from
              the selection's children.  View commands can be used to hide the
              display of children if desired.</li>

              <li>Keyboard shortcuts can be customized by editing the TreeLine
              configuration file ("~/.treeline" on Linux, "treeline.ini" on
              windows).  Any configuration files from previous versions should
              be deleted when installing TreeLine
              0.6.0.</li>

              <li>A new command will quickly set a node's data type.</li>

              <li>Parent nodes will automatically open and close when found
              with the two search methods, by typing the first letter and with
              the "next sibling" keyboard command.  This behavior can be
              disabled with a new general option.</li>

              <li>Typing a lowercase letter will move forward through the
              visible tree items that start with that letter.  An uppercase
              letter will move backward.</li>

              <li>Tree items (including those not visible) can be
              incrementally searched by typing "/" followed by the search
              string.</li>

              <li>The Find dialog box is now modeless (the program may be
              operated while the dialog is open).</li>

              <li>A "Choice" field type has been added that allows selection
              from a user-defined list of strings.</li>

              <li>A "Combination" field type has been added that allows
              selection of several items from a user-defined list of
              strings.</li>

              <li>Several linking field types have been added, including
              "URL", "Path", "Email", and "Picture".  Clicking on a "URL" or
              "Path" in the output window will open the link in an external
              browser.  The "Picture" fields are shown on in the output window
              for certain image formats.</li>

              <li>Pull-down editors have been added for the "Choice",
              "Combination", "Date", "Time", and "Boolean" field types.</li>

              <li>A font selection for the data output view has been added to
              the general options.</li>

              <li>New printing options include setting the print font and
              setting a default page size.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Configuration information is properly saved for unused node
              data types.</li>

              <li>TreeLine is now more keyboard-friendly in many ways.</li>

              <li>Window captions now put the file name first.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed problems with data edit view resizing (on Qt3
              only).</li>

              <li>Fixed file corruption problems caused by the use of HTML
              characters in the field format's prefix and suffix areas.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>March 14, 2003 - Release 0.5.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>
