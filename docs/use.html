<a id="basic_usage"></a> <h2>Basic Usage</h2>

<a id="views"></a> <h3>Views</h3>

<p><b>Tree View</b> - The left-hand view shows a tree of node titles. Parent
nodes can be opened and closed to display or hide their indented descendant
nodes.  Clicking on an already selected node allows the title to be edited.
Right-click context menus are available for commonly used functions.</p>

<p><b>Breadcrumb View</b> - The top pane shows the parent and ancestors of the
selected node. It is blank if no nodes or multiple nodes are selected.
Ancestors with blue text can be clicked to select those nodes.</p>

<p><b>Right-hand Views</b> - The right pane is tabbed to show one of three
different views of the data. The "Data Output" view shows the formatted text,
the "Data Edit" view shows text edit boxes, and the "Title List" view shows an
editable list of node titles.</p>

<p>When a parent node is selected in the tree, the right view will default to
showing information about the selected node in an upper pane and information
about the selected node's children in a lower pane. The "View &gt; Show Child
Pane" command will toggle the display of the child nodes. If the selected node
has no children, the view will show a single pane with information about the
selected node only.</p>

<p>When multiple nodes are selected in the tree (by holding down the shift or
Ctrl keys while clicking), the right view will not display any child node
information. It will instead show information about every selected node.</p>

<p>When no nodes are selected in the tree (by clicking on a blank area or Ctrl
clicking to unselect), the right view will show information about the
top-level (root) nodes.</p>

<p><b>Data Output View</b> - The "Data Output" view shows formatted output
text. It cannot be edited from this view.</p>

<p>When the "View &gt; Show Output Descendants" command is toggled, the "Data
Output" view will show an indented list with information about every
descendant of a single selected node.</p>

<p><b>Data Edit View</b> - The "Data Edit" view shows a text edit box for each
data field within a node.  It also shows the node types and the node titles.
The types of edit boxes vary based on the field type.  Some are just text
editors, while others (such as choice fields, date fields, links, etc.) have
pull-down menus or dialogs.</p>

<p><b>Title List View</b> - The "Title List" view shows a list of node titles
that can be modified using typical text editor methods.  If a new line is
typed, a new node is created with that title.  If a line is deleted, the
corresponding node is removed from the tree.</p>

<a id="editing"></a> <h3>Editing</h3>

<p><b>Node Menu</b> - The commands in the "Node" menu operate on the selected
nodes in the left tree view. There are commands to add or insert nodes, rename
node titles and delete nodes. There are also commands to rearrange the tree by
changing indent levels or moving nodes up or down. For many of the commands,
the descendants of the selected nodes are also affected.</p>

<p><b>Edit Menu</b> - The edit menu includes undo and redo commands that can
fix problems. Cut, copy and paste commands can operate either on text in the
right-hand view (if selected or active) or to tree nodes.</p>

<p><b>Format Menu</b> - The format menu has text formatting commands that are
active when using edit boxes in the Data Edit view.</p>

<p><b>Shortcuts</b> - There are several shortcuts for use in tree editing.
Drag and drop will move (or copy if the Ctrl button is held) nodes. Clicking
on a selected node will rename it. Pressing the delete key will remove the
selected nodes.  If desired, these shortcuts can be disabled in "Tools &gt;
General Options".</p>

<a id="files"></a> <h3>Files</h3>

<p><b>Templates</b> - When starting a new file, a dialog box offers a choice
of templates. The default has only a single text field for each node that
contains the title. The Long Text template adds a second long text field for
more output text. Other templates have various fields for contacts, book lists
and to-do lists.</p>

<p><b>Sample Files</b> - Various TreeLine sample files can be opened by using
the "File &gt; Open Sample" command.  These have more detail and example
content than the new file templates.</p>

<a id="data_types"></a> <h3>Data Types</h3>

<p><b>Node Types</b> - Multiple node data types can be defined in a TreeLine
file.  Each can contain different data fields and have different output
formats. See the template and sample files for examples. Nodes can be set to a
specific type using the "Data &gt; Set Node Type" command.</p>

<p><b>Type Config</b> - The "Data &gt; Configure Data Types" command is used
to modify node data types, fields and output formatting.  Refer to the
Detailed Usage section of the full documentation for details.</p>

<a id="detailed_usage"></a> <h2>Detailed Usage</h2>

<a id="tree_navigation_and_search"></a> <h3>Tree Navigation and Search</h3>

<p><b>Keyboard Shortcuts</b> - There are several keyboard commands that can be
used for tree navigation. The up and down arrow keys move the selection. The
left and right arrows open and close the current node. The "Home", "End",
"Page Up" and "Page Down" keys can be used to move quickly through the
tree.</p>

<p>Another way to move through the tree is to type the first letter of a
visible node title. Hitting the letter again highlights to the next
possibility.</p>

<p><b>Selection</b> - Multiple nodes can be selected by holding down the CTRL
or the SHIFT key when changing the active node. Individual nodes are added or
removed from the selection when the CTRL key is held. The selection of all
nodes between the old and new active nodes are toggled when SHIFT is held. The
active node can be changed by using the mouse or by using any of the keyboard
navigation methods.</p>

<p>The "View &gt; Previous Selection" and "View &gt; Next Selection" commands
can be used to toggle through a history of selections, allowing faster
navigation through the tree.</p>

<p><b>Searching</b> - The "Tools &gt; Find Text" command will search for text
within the tree structure. The dialog box has options for searching all of the
node data or only the node titles. There are also options for how to interpret
the search text. Key words will match nodes with the search words found
anywhere in the node. Key full words will only match complete words anywhere
in the node. Full phrase will only match the complete phrase in the proper
sequence.  Finally, the regular expression option will search using Python
regular expressions.</p>

<p>The "Tools &gt; Conditional Find" command will search in particular node
types and node fields. Various comparison operators can be selected to exactly
match, to match a greater or lesser value, or part of the value. And the
True/False operators give the same result regardless of the values. In
general, the value is interpreted using the edit format for special field
types. Multiple rules can be added, connected with logical "and" or "or"
operators. The "All Types" option makes fields from every type are available,
so that multiple node types to be part of the same search. The condition will
be false for node types that do not contain that field name.</p>

<p>There is also a quick, incremental search of node titles. By default, it's
bound to ctrl+/. Then, matching titles are found as the search string is
typed. The F3 and shift+F3 keys can be used to go to the next or previous
matches, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Filtering</b> - There are two filtering commands, "Tools &gt; Text
Filter" and "Tools &gt; Conditional Filter". They work like the corresponding
search commands above, except that they show all of the matching nodes in a
flat list that replaces the tree view. The nodes can be selected and edited
from this view. Use the "End Filter" button to restore the full tree view.</p>

<p>Searches for Conditional Find and Conditional Filter can be saved in the
dialog boxes and loaded again at another time.</p>

<a id="defining_node_types"></a> <h3>Defining Node Types</h3>

<p><b>Type List</b> - The "Type List" is the first tab of the "Data &gt;
Configure Types Dialog". The list of data types can be modified by the buttons
on the right.  New types can be added, and existing types can be copied,
renamed or deleted.</p>

<p><b>Type Config</b> - "Type Config" is the second tab of the Configure Types
Dialog.  It contains a selection for the default child type. If set, this will
be the initial type used for new children with this type of parent. If set to
"[None]", children will default to either the type of their siblings or their
parent.</p>

<p>The "Change Icon" button allows the selection of a custom tree icon for
this data type. The "Clear Select" button on the icon dialog can be used to
set the icon to "None", so that no icon will be displayed for this type. To
avoid showing any tree icons, the "Show icons in the tree view" general option
can be unset.</p>

<p>There are also options here for adding blanks lines between nodes, allowing
HTML tags in the common format text, and changing the output to add bullets or
tables.</p>

<p><b>Field List</b> - The "Field List" is the third tab of the Configure
Types Dialog.  The list of fields within a data type can be modified by using
the buttons on the right. New fields can be added, and existing fields can be
moved, renamed or deleted.  Sort keys can also be defined to specify the
fields that are compared when nodes are sorted.</p>

<p><b>Field Config</b> - "Field Config" is the fourth tab of the Configure
Types Dialog.  The field type and its output format string can be set, if
applicable to the field. Extra prefix and suffix text to be output with the
field can also be set, and a default field value for new nodes can be entered.
The number of lines displayed in the editor for the field can also be
specified.  Finally, an option to evaluate HTML tags can be set to recognize
HTML tags in Choice, AutoChoice, Combination, AutoCombination and
RegularExpression fields.  If this is set, special characters (angled brackets
and quotation marks) will need to be manually escaped to show up in the field
text.</p>

<p><b>Output</b> - "Output" is the last tab of the Configure Types Dialog. The
left half of the dialog shows the fields. The right half shows the formatting
for the title (used for the node text in the tree view) and the node output.
The formatting consists of text lines with embedded fields. The fields are
shown as "{*field_name*}". The fields that are selected in the list (multiple
fields can be selected by holding Ctrl or Shift keys while clicking) can be
added to a format at the cursor position with the "&gt;&gt;" keys. The field
reference at the cursor can be removed with the "&lt;&lt;" keys.</p>

<a id="field_types"></a> <h3>Field Types</h3>

<p><b>Field Options</b> - The field type and options are set in the "Field
Config" tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". The many different
field types are described in the paragraphs below.</p>

<p>Several of the field types use a formatting string to define their output.
For a list of available formatting characters, use the "Format Help" button.
Entries in the data editor which do not match the format will cause a blue
triangle to show in the upper left corner of the edit box, and the output for
that field will be replaced with "#####".</p>

<p><b>Text Type</b> - The default field type is a text field. It is the most
commonly used field. These fields are edited using edit boxes in the data
editor view.  There are several commands in the Format menu (and also in the
context menu) for setting the font style and adding external or internal
links. The edit box height expands when re-displayed after adding several
lines of text. The minimum edit box height can also be set explicitly in the
"Field Config" tab.</p>

<p><b>HTML Text Type</b> - This type allows simple HTML tags to be used in the
text. Commonly used tags include "&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;",
"&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;", "line break&lt;br/&gt;", "horizontal
line&lt;hr/&gt;", and various font tags. Complex block tags should generally
be avoided. Carriage returns are ignored and non-escaped "&lt;", "&gt;" and
"&amp;" symbols do not display. </p>

<p><b>One Line Text Type</b> - This type restricts the text length to a single
line.  It does not allow carriage returns but does not restrict line wrapping
of a single long line.</p>

<p><b>Spaced Text Type</b> - This type holds plain text and preserves all
spacing.  Other formatting of the text is not permitted.  It could be useful
to use the "Tools &gt; Customize Fonts" command to set the editor font to a
mono-spaced font when using this field type.</p>

<p><b>Number Type</b> - In the number type, special characters in the format
define the display of the numbers. The format uses a string of "#" (optional
digit) and "0" (required digit) characters to define the output formatting.
For example, pi formatted with "#.#" is "3.1" and formatted with "00.00" is
"03.14".  Regardless of the formatting, digits to the left of the decimal
point are not truncated, since that would display an incorrect result. But use
care to show enough decimal places (either optional or required) to avoid
problems with round-off error.</p>

<p>The radix character can be specified as either "." or "," to handle
internationalization. For use as a thousands separator, use "\," or "\.". For
example, a large number may be formatted as "#\,###\,###.##" or as
"#\.###\.###,##". Press the "Format Help" button from the field format dialog
for more formatting details. </p>

<p>Unlike most other formats, the number type also uses the output format for
display in the Data Editor. Of course, any new entry with a reasonable format
is correctly interpreted (but the correct radix character must be used).</p>

<p><a id="math_type"></a><b>Math Type</b> - Math field types are configured by
defining equations.  The equations can reference number fields, date fields,
time fields, boolean fields, text fields and/or other math fields. The
resulting values of math fields are automatically calculated for each
node. Various mathematical, relational and string operators are available.
The results can be numbers, text, boolean, dates or times.</p>

<p>To define a math field equation, press the "Define Equation" button in the
"Field Config" tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". This brings up a
dialog with fields to reference on the left and math operators on the right.
The "Reference Level" pull-down determines whether the reference is from the
same node, the node's parent, the root node, or the node's children. The
"Result Type" pull-down allows arithmetic, date, time, boolean or text results
to be chosen. The "Operator Type" pull-down allows numeric, comparison or text
operators to be shown in the operator list. The down-arrow buttons below the
references and operators add the selected item to the equation text below.
Portions of equations can also be typed directly in the equation text line
editor.</p>

<p>References to child nodes must be enclosed in a grouping function, such as
sum, max, min, mean or join. A math field can contain a parent or child
reference to itself, but not a same-level reference to itself (a circular
reference). The references only contain the field name, so they will reference
a parent or child field with that name even if it is a different node
type.</p>

<p>In equations, date fields are represented by the number of days since
January 1, 1970, and time fields are the number of seconds since midnight. So
date fields can be subtracted to give the number of days elapsed, and numbers
of days can be added to or subtracted from dates to result in new dates. Time
fields can be subtracted to give the number of seconds elapsed, and numbers of
seconds can be added to or subtracted from times to result in new times.</p>

<p>The "if" comparison operator can be used to make the result depend on the
value of another field. The expression is written as "true_value if condition
else false_value". Of course, the "true_value", "condition" and "false_value"
strings must be replaced with valid fields or expressions. If this operator is
inserted from the operator list (under comparisons), it will include
parenthesis as placeholders. These parenthesis are optional in the
equations.</p>

<p>The "join" text function is used to combine text from several other fields
(or from child nodes). The first argument to the function is a separator
string that is placed between each piece of text. The remaining argument(s)
are the text to be joined.</p>

<p>By default, math fields are shown in the data edit view, but they are
read-only. To hide them, uncheck the "Show math fields in the Data Edit View"
box under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Features Available".</p>

<p>There is also an option under "File &gt; Properties" that toggles whether
blank fields are treated as zeros. If checked (the default), a blank field
that is referenced by a math field has a value of zero (for numeric
operations) or blank (for text operations). If unchecked, any blank references
also cause equations that reference them to be blank.</p>

<p><a id="numbering_type"></a><b>Numbering Type</b> - This type (not to be
confused with the number type above) provides fields that are automatically
filled in with the "Data &gt; Update Numbering" command. The "Format Help"
button in the field format dialog shows the output format options. A single
format level will result in a simple sequential numbering scheme. Use of the
"/" level separator will result in an outline-type numbering with different
sequences at different levels. Use of the "." section separator will result in
a "2.3.5" type numbering scheme.</p>

<p>Since numbering fields are automatically populated, by default they are not
shown in the data edit view.  To show them, check the "Show numbering fields
in the Data Edit View" box under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Features
Available".  When they are shown in the data edit view, they show up in
section numbering style, regardless of the output format.</p>

<p><b>Date Type</b> - In the date field type, special characters in the format
(all starting with "%") are replaced by elements of the data, similar to
number fields. Press the "Format Help" button from the field format dialog for
formatting details.  Non-special characters will be output as themselves.</p>

<p>There is also an edit format under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Data
Editor Formats". This controls how date fields are displayed in the Data
Editor view.  Generally, entries in the data editor with various formats will
be correctly interpreted regardless of this setting, but dates must use the
correct day-month-year sequence. Also note that the date editor format does
not support days of the week.</p>

<p>A default initial field value of "Now" can be used to enter the date of
node creation.</p>

<p><b>Time Type</b> - In the time field type, special characters in the format
(all starting with "%") are replaced by elements of the data, similar to
number fields. Press the "Format Help" button from the field format dialog for
formatting details. Non-special characters will be output as themselves. </p>

<p>There is also an edit format under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Data
Editor Formats". This controls how time fields are displayed in the Data
Editor view.  Generally, entries in the data editor with various formats will
be correctly interpreted regardless of this setting.</p>

<p>A default initial field value of "Now" can be used to enter the time of
node creation.</p>

<p><b>DateTime Type</b> - The DateTime field combines dates and times into a
single field that is useful for timestamps. Special characters in the format
(all starting with "%") are replaced by elements of the data, as in date and
time fields. Press the "Format Help" button from the field format dialog for
formatting details. Non-special characters will be output as themselves. </p>

<p>The DateTime edit format is uses the date and time formats located in
"Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Data Editor Formats". The date and time
formats are combined, separated by a space character.</p>

<p>A default initial field value of "Now" can be used to enter the date and
time of node creation.</p>

<p><b>Boolean Type</b> - This type gives two choices corresponding to
true/false values.  The format help menu includes typical values such as
"yes/no", "true/false" and "1/0", but users can also enter their own word
pair. The data editor boxes will accept either the currently set format or any
of the typical values.</p>

<p><b>Choice Type</b> - The choice field type allows for the selection of text
items from a pull-down edit list. The formatting strings for these types list
the items separated with the "/" character (use "//" to get a literal "/" in
an item).  Entries in the data editor which do not match the choices will
cause a blue triangle to show in the upper left corner of the edit box, and
the output for that field will be replaced with "#####".</p>

<p><b>Auto Choice Type</b> - This field type is similar to the choice type,
but without a format string. The entries in the pull-down menu are
automatically generated from all previously used entries. Any entries that are
typed will be available in the pull-down menu for future use. </p>

<p><b>Combination Type</b> - This is basically the equivalent of the choice
type with multiple selection. The formatting string entries are separated by
the "/" character. The pull-down menu shows check-boxes that are checked for
currently selected nodes. By default, the selected entries are output
separated by a comma and a space. This can be changed in the "Type Config" tab
of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". Click the "Show Advanced" button to
see the separator setting.</p>

<p><b>Auto Combination Type</b> - This field type is similar to the
combination type, but without a format string. The entries in the pull-down
menu are automatically generated from all previously used entries. Any entries
that are typed will be available in the pull-down menu for future use. </p>

<p><b>External Link Type</b> - This type can support various link protocols,
including http and https for web pages, mailto for email addresses and file
for local files.  A pull down dialog in the data editor allows the selection
of the protocol type and the entry of an address and a display name.  In the
edit boxes, the display name shows up in [brackets], and it is used as the
text of the link in the output view.  The "file" protocol also provides a
button to browse for a path and buttons to choose either absolute or relative
path names.</p>

<p>Clicking on the link in the output view or choosing "Open Link" from the
right-click context menu in the edit box will open the link in a web browser.
In Linux, setting the "BROWSER" environment variable to a string like "mozilla
%s" will result in the desired browser being used.</p>

<p><b>Internal Link Type</b> - These links create shortcuts to select nodes
elsewhere in the tree structure. To create a link, click the pull-down arrow
and then select the target node in the tree view. The display name is shown in
brackets. It is initially set to the target node title, but it can be edited.
The right-click context menu can be used to clear the link or to select the
target node.</p>

<p>Clicking the link in the output view will select the target node in the
tree view.</p>

<p><b>Picture Type</b> - These links add referenced pictures to the output
view. A pull down dialog in the data editor has a button to browse for picture
files to be linked. It also allows absolute or relative paths to be used and
has a small image preview.</p>

<p><b>Regular Expression Type</b> - This type allows arbitrary format strings
to be matched that restrict the data to a particular format. It uses Python
regular expression syntax. Entries in the data editor which do not match the
format string expression will cause a blue triangle to show in the upper left
corner of the edit box, and the output for that field will be replaced with
"#####".</p>

<a id="output_formatting_details"></a> <h3>Output Formatting Details</h3>

<p><b>Output Format Examples</b> - Here is an example of output formatting for
a book list:</p>

<p>"{*Title*}" (c) {*Copyright*}, Rating: {*Rating*} {*PlotDescription*}</p>

<p>Each of the field names in enclosed in {* *}, curly brackets and asterisks.
For more examples, see the sample files that can be opened using the "File
&gt; Open Sample" command.</p>

<p><b>Title Formats</b> - When a node in the tree is renamed, the program
attempts to match the title formatting pattern to set the appropriate fields
(the same title matching occurs when editing lines in the "Title List" view).
If the title formatting is too complex, it may not correctly guess the intent.
Things like adjacent fields with no characters separating them should be
avoided unless you do not wish to rename nodes from the tree.</p>

<p>If the text data used for a tree view title has multiple lines, only the
first line will be used as the title.</p>

<p><b>Skipped Output Lines</b> - If all of the fields in an output format line
are empty for a given node, then the line is skipped. No blank line or
embedded text will be output for that line. Note that this does not apply to a
line without any fields (only embedded text). Also, when a line ending with a
&lt;br/&gt; or an &lt;hr/&gt; tag is skipped, the ending tag is retained.</p>

<p><b>HTML Tags</b> - By default, the "Allow HTML rich text in formats" option
is unchecked  in the "Type Config"  tab of the Configure Types Dialog.  So any
HTML tags are treated as plain text.  If the option is enabled, simple HTML
formatting tags can be used in node output formats.</p>

<p>Commonly used tags include "&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;",
"&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;", "line break&lt;br/&gt;", "horizontal
line&lt;hr/&gt;", and various font tags. Complex block tags should generally
be avoided.</p>

<p><b>Other Field References</b> - References to fields that are not contained
within the node can be added to the output. Pushing the "Show Advanced" button
on the "Output" tab of the configure dialog makes a reference level selection
become visible.</p>

<p>If the reference level is changed to "File Info Reference", fields
containing file meta-data can be added to the output. These include the file
name, path, size, modified date and modified time. These special fields are
shown as "{*!field_name*}" in the title and output format editors.</p>

<p>There are field references to various ancestor nodes (parents,
grandparents, etc.). These require the data type of the reference to be
specified. This selection determines the field names that are available, but
the data from any type with a matching field name will be shown in the output.
References to fields from parent and grandparent nodes are shown as
"{**field_name*}" and "{***field_name*}", respectively. There are also general
ancestor references, shown as "{*?field_name*}", that take data from the
closest ancestor with a matching field.</p>

<p>References to child nodes can also be added, shown as "{*&field_name*}".
These also require that the child data type be specified. The child data
becomes embedded in the parent output. The child data is delimited with a
separator string defined on the "Type Config" tab (with show advanced active).
The separator defaults to a comma and a space, but can be set to &lt;br/&gt;
or anything else.</p>

<p>Finally, a "Child Count" reference can be added. This field will show the
number of children ("Level1" field) or grandchildren ("Level2" field) of a
node. These are shown as {*#Level1*} in the format editors.</p>

<p>For examples of these fields, see the "sample_other_fields" file (by using
the "File &gt; Open Sample" command).</p>

<p><b>Math Fields</b> - For more complex output formatting, the math field can
be used to combine other fields using various mathematical, relational and
string operators. See the <a href="#math_type">Math Type</a> section for
details.</p>

<a id="type_format_details"></a> <h3>Type Format Details</h3>

<p><b>Generic and Derived Types</b> - Data types can be set to derive their
field settings from a generic type. This allows types with different output
formatting to always use the same set of fields. Any changes to the generic's
list of fields and field types are automatically reflected in the fields of
all derived types. This does not apply to a field's output formatting, which
can still be set independently.</p>

<p>There are two methods for creating derived types. First, a derived option
can be selected when copying a type on the "Type List" tab of the "Data &gt;
Configure Types Dialog". Alternately, a generic type can be specified from the
derived type's "Type Config" tab of the dialog if the advanced functions are
shown.</p>

<p><b>Conditional Types</b> - Conditional expressions can be used to
automatically assign a data type based on each node's content. Conditions can
be assigned only to a generic type and its associated derived types. This
allows the automatic assignment of different output formatting or different
icons depending on each node's field data.</p>

<p>The conditional dialog box is accessed from a button on the "Type Config"
tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog" if the advanced functions are
shown.  Each line of the condition includes a field, an operator and a
comparison value. The operators include equality, greater than, less than,
starts with, ends with, and contains. There are also True and False operators
that will toggle the type of all nodes simultaneously.</p>

<p>For special field types such as dates, times, and booleans, the comparison
value should be entered in the same format that is used in the Data Editor
window. In general, the starts with, ends with, and contains operators should
not be used for these special fields, since the comparison is done using an
internal data representation. Dates and times also support a special
comparison value of "now", which is always interpreted as the current date and
time.</p>

<p>The "Add New Rule" button is used to add additional condition lines. The
lines can be joined with "and" or "or" operators. The "Remove Rule" button
deletes the last condition line. If only a single line is present, the "Remove
Rule" button completely removes the condition.</p>

<p>Conditions do not have to be set for all types in a family. If no
conditions are true for a node, the program will select a blank condition
rather than a false one.</p>

<p>For an example, see the "sample_conditional_todo" file (by using the "File
&gt; Open Sample" command).</p>

<p><b>Copying Formats</b> - Another method for changing data type formatting
is to copy the formats from another TreeLine file. This is done with the "Data
&gt; Copy Types from File" command. All types from the chosen file are copied.
Any types in the current file with matching names are overwritten, but types
with unique names are retained.</p>

<p><b>Child Type Limits</b> - In addition to setting the default child type,
the child node types that are available to be set can be limited. There is a
pull-down list of child type limits in the "Type Config" tab of the
configuration dialog if the advanced functions are shown. Only checked types
will show up in the type lists when using the "Data &gt; Set Node Type"
command on a child node.</p>

<a id="tree_data_operations"></a> <h3>Tree Data Operations</h3>

<p><b>Sorting</b> - The "Data &gt; Sort Nodes" command can sort nodes based on
either node titles or key fields predefined in the node type configuration.
The predefined sort fields can be changed in the "Field Config" tab of the
Configure Types Dialog. The "Sort Keys" button brings up a list of fields that
define a sort key sequence.  The fields higher in the sequence have a higher
priority.  The direction for each key field can be flipped.</p>

<p><b>Numbering</b> - The "Data &gt; Update Numbering" command updates the
contents of fields with a special numbering field type. The field's output
format defines how the numbers are displayed in the output, including whether
individual numbers, outline numbers or a section numbering scheme are shown.
See the <a href="#numbering_type">Numbering Field Type</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>Note that numbering fields are not shown in the data edit view unless "Show
numbering fields in the Data Edit View" is checked under "Tools &gt; General
Options &gt; Features Available". When they are shown in the data edit view,
they show up in section numbering style, regardless of the output format.</p>

<p><b>Find and Replace</b> - The "Tools &gt; Find and Replace" command can be
used to change the text in several nodes. The search text and replacement text
are entered. Searching can be based on any match, full words only, or a Python
regular expression. The operation can optionally be restricted to a particular
node type and to a particular node field.</p>

<p>Replacement using regular expressions is quite powerful. Searching for ".*"
will match all of the text in the field. The replacement string can contain
back references that consist of a backslash and a number. The back references
get replaced with the corresponding parenthesized group from the match. For
example, "\2" will be replaced with the text that matched the second group of
parenthesis. The "\g&lt;0&gt;" back-reference can be used to substitute the
entire matching string.</p>

<p><b>Spell Check</b> - There is a spell check command in the "Tools" menu.
Use of this command requires an external program to be installed (either
aspell, ispell or hunspell- see the <a href="require.html">System
Requirements</a> section). If there are any misspelled words in the selected
branch, a dialog will allow the word to be ignored, added to the dictionary,
replaced with a suggestion or edited.  This will spell check the text in all
data fields of each node.</p>

<p><b>Cloned Nodes</b> - Cloned nodes are used to duplicate sections of the
tree.  Editing their data or child structure in one location changes all
locations.  When a cloned node is selected, multiple lines are shown in the
Breadcrumb view, showing ancestor nodes that have multiple parents. The
selected node will appear black (not a link), but its clones can be clicked to
select their location in the tree view.</p>

<p>Cloned nodes are created by copying nodes or branches and then using the
special paste clone commands found in the "Edit" menu to paste them elsewhere.
The clone link can be removed by deleting the nodes or by using the "Data &gt;
Detach Clones" command to convert them back to regular nodes.</p>

<p>Cloned nodes can also be created automatically by using the "Data &gt;
Clone All Matched Nodes" command. This will convert all identical nodes in the
tree structure into cloned nodes.</p>

<p>For an example of cloned nodes with multiple parents, see the
"sample_genealogy" file (by using the "File &gt; Open Sample" command).</p>

<p><b>Category-Based Arrangement</b> - The "Data" menu contains commands for
arranging and flattening the data by category. These methods are used to
automatically add and remove levels of nodes below the current node in the
tree.</p>

<p>The "Add Category Level" command allows you to select one or more of the
fields that the child nodes have in common. These fields are used to create
new parent nodes for the children, grouping them by common categories. For
example, in a list of books, picking the "author_first_name" and
"author_last_name" fields will result in a tree with the books under new nodes
for each unique author.</p>

<p>The "Flatten by Category" command is almost the opposite of "Add Category
Level". It eliminates any descendant nodes with children, transferring their
data fields to their children. It will rename fields instead of overwriting
data with the same field names, but this command is most useful when the
children and parents are different types with unique field names.</p>

<p>There is also a "Swap Category Levels" command that will swap the child and
grandchild nodes beneath a selected node.  A child node with multiple nodes
under it will become cloned under each one.  Any existing grandchild clones
will become individual nodes with multiple children.</p>

<a id="printing"></a> <h3>Printing</h3>

<p><b>Print Setup</b> - The dialog for print setup contains four tabs. The
first, General Options, includes settings for what part of the tree to print,
whether to include lines to child nodes and whether to allow page breaks
between a parent an its first child node. It also has place to set the printer
queue, to make pagination and print previews more accurate.  The second tab,
Page Setup, includes paper size, orientation, margins and columns. The third
tab selects the font for printing. The last tab, Header/Footer, defines text
and file data meta-fields for inclusion in headers and footers.</p>

<p><b>Print Preview</b> - The Print Preview window shows how the printout will
look with current print settings.  It can be dragged larger to show more
detail, or the zoom settings can be changed.  It also includes buttons for the
Print Setup dialog and for printing.</p>

<p><b>Print to PDF</b> - This command prompts for a path and file name to
export a PDF file.  It uses the current printer settings.</p>

<a id="file_handling"></a> <h3>File Handling</h3>

<p><b>File Compression</b> - A TreeLine file is in a JSON text format. There
are options to compress the files (gzip format) to save storage space.
Individual files can be set to compressed mode from either "File &gt;
Properties" or from the file type pull-down in the save-as dialog.</p>

<p><b>File Encryption</b> - There is a file encryption option to password
protect TreeLine files. Individual files can be set to encrypted mode from
either "File &gt; Properties" or from the file type pull-down in the save-as
dialog. The encryption uses an SHA hash function as a stream cipher - it
should be fairly secure.</p>

<p><b>Auto-Save</b> - An auto-save feature can store unsaved files with a "~"
appended to the file name. The backup files are automatically removed when the
file is saved or TreeLine exits cleanly. The auto-save time interval is set in
the general options. Setting the interval to zero disables this feature.</p>

<p><b>Saved Tree States</b> - When opening a recently used file, TreeLine will
restore the states of open and selected nodes. This information is stored in
the user's TreeLine configuration files. If desired, this feature can be
disabled with a general option.</p>

<a id="file_import"></a> <h3>File Import</h3>

<p><b>General Information</b> - A TreeLine file is in a specific JSON text
format.  Other types of files can be imported using the "File &gt; Import"
command, which will show a dialog box where the type of import can be
selected.  Alternatively, using the "File &gt; Open" command with a
non-TreeLine file will also show this dialog.</p>

<p><b>Text Import</b> - Several different text formats can be selected for
import.  Tab indented text creates a node title from each line in the file,
structured based on the number of tabs before each line.</p>

<p>The comma-delimited (CSV) and the tab delimited text tables use the first
line as a header row to create field names, then each additional row becomes a
node with field data taken from each column. The CSV import with level numbers
creates a tree structure from level numbers in the first column that are
incremented to show child relationships.</p>

<p>The plain text, one node per line import creates a flat tree of node
titles. </p>

<p>Finally, the plain text paragraph import creates long text nodes from text
separated by blank lines.</p>

<p><b>Bookmarks Import</b> - TreeLine will import bookmark files in both the
Mozilla HTML format (Firefox browser) and the XBEL format (Konqueror, Galeon
and Elinks browsers). Each bookmark becomes a node with a name and a link
field.  Some information in the files, such as visited dates and icon
references, is not imported. For an example, see the "sample_bookmarks" file
(by using the "File &gt; Open Sample" command).</p>

<p><b>Old TreeLine Import</b> - Files from older versions of TreeLine (1.x or
2.x) can be imported. These files are in XML format and generally have a
  ".trl" file extension (current files are in JSON format with a ".trln" file
extension).  Unlike other file imports, these older files will import without
showing the import dialog box when using the "File &gt; Open" command.</p>

<p><b>Treepad Import</b> - Files from the Treepad shareware program can be
imported.  Only Treepad text nodes are supported.</p>

<p><b>XML Import</b> - TreeLine will import and export generic XML files.
These routines do not have much intelligence - each XML element becomes a node
and each XML attribute becomes a field. XML text content become fields named
"Element_Data". This lets TreeLine function as a crude XML editor.</p>

<p><b>ODF Import</b> - TreeLine will import Open Document Format (ODF) text
documents, from applications such as Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice. The
node structure is formed based on the heading styles assigned in the document.
Any text under each heading is assigned to that heading's node. The import
filter is intended for simple text outlines only. No formatting is maintained,
and objects such as tables and pictures are not imported.</p>

<p> <a id="file_export"></a> <h3>File Export</h3>

<p><b>General Information</b> - Files are exported using the "File &gt;
Export" command.  This will show a dialog box of available export types and
options.</p>

<p><b>HTML Export</b> - The HTML export subtypes can export to a single page
or to multiple pages. The single page export contains all of the indented
output. A navigation pane on the left with links to anchors at node positions
is optional.</p>

<p>The multiple HTML pages export has one web page per node. It includes a
navigation pane on the left with links to the pages with sibling, parent and
aunt/uncle nodes.</p>

<p>Multiple HTML data tables export creates a table in each HTML file that
contains the data for a set of siblings, as well as links to the parent and
child pages.</p>

<p>The Live Tree HTML export uses Javascript and CSS to create an interactive
view. Nodes in the tree can be expanded and collapsed, and a separate pane
shows the output for all descendants of the selected node. The first form of
this export creates separate files that are linked to the existing TreeLine
file. These files are intended for use on a web server (browser security
usually prevents local access). The HTML file stores the relative path from
the TreeLine file to the initial export directory, so this relationship needs
to be maintained on the web server. Only the TreeLine file needs to be
replaced to update the data (re-export is not required).</p>

<p>The second form of Live Tree export creates a single file (with embedded
data) that can be accessed from a local web browser.  It appears the same as
the first form on the browser.</p>

<p><b>Text Export</b> - Data can be exported to tabbed title text,
comma-delimited (CSV) tables and tab-delimited tables. These formats are the
same as the corresponding import formats. </p>

<p>There is also an unformatted text export the dumps all of the output into a
text file without preserving the tree structure.</p>

<p><b>TreeLine Export</b> - Files can be exported that are compatible with
older versions of TreeLine (1.x and 2.x), with a ".trl" file extension.  Some
newer features, such as cloned nodes and multiple root nodes may not be
completely preserved.  TreeLine subtrees can also be exported to save just
selected branches of the tree to a file using the current TreeLine
version.</p>

<p><b>XML Export</b> - TreeLine will import and export generic XML files.
These routines do not have much intelligence - each node becomes an XML
element and each field becomes an XML attribute, except for fields named
"Element_Data" that become the element's text. This lets TreeLine function as
a crude XML editor.</p>

<p><b>ODF Export</b> - TreeLine will export an outline to an Open Document
Format (ODF) text document, compatible with Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice.
The title of each node is assigned a heading style at the appropriate level.
Any other text in the output of each node becomes normal text under the
heading.  The export filter is intended for simple text outlines only. Any
HTML formatting is stripped, and objects such as tables and pictures are not
supported.</p>

<p><b>Bookmarks Export</b> - TreeLine will export bookmark files in both the
Mozilla HTML format (Firefox browser) and the XBEL format (Konqueror, Galeon
and Elinks browsers). TreeLine will look for a link field in each node that
becomes the target of the bookmark.</p>

<a id="customizations"></a> <h3>Customizations</h3>

<p><b>Options</b> - TreeLine's behavior can be modified with several settings
available in "Tools &gt; General Options". Most of these options are covered
elsewhere in this document.</p>

<p><b>Keyboard Shortcuts</b> - Keyboard shortcuts can be customized by using
the "Tools &gt; Set Keyboard Shortcuts" command. Simply type the new key
sequence with the appropriate field selected.</p>

<p><b>Toolbars</b> - An editor to customize the toolbars is available from
"Tools &gt; Customize Toolbars". The number of toolbars can be set, and the
buttons on each can be defined.</p>

<p><b>Fonts</b> - The default font used in the application  can be set using
the "Tools &gt; Customize Fonts" menu.  There are also options to specify
fonts used in the tree views, the output view and the editor views.</p>

<p><b>Tree Icons</b> - There is an icons directory in the user configuration
directory ("~/.treeline-x.x/icons" on Linux,
"Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\roaming\bellz\treeline-x.x\icons" on Windows).
Image files (PNG or BMP) placed into this directory are available for use as
tree icons.</p>

<p><b>Translations</b> - Translations of the TreeLine GUI are available in
German and Spanish. The translation should load automatically if the OS locale
is properly set. Alternatively, "--lang xx" can be appended to the command
that starts TreeLine, where "xx" is the two-letter language code ("en", "de"
or "es").</p>
